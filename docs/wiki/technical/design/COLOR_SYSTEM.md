# Color System




> Colors that match your media management stack

The Revenge color system aligns with the Arr ecosystem you already know. Movies use Radarr's gold, TV uses Sonarr's blue, Music uses Lidarr's green, and Adult uses Whisparr's pink. Each module shifts the entire UI theme - not just accents, but backgrounds, cards, and navigation. Dark theme is default with full light mode support.
