> Unlock the spirit of the Queen Anne's Revenge

Pirate Mode transforms Revenge with nautical theming inspired by Blackbeard's legendary Queen Anne's Revenge. Unlock elements by using features - watch movies to get the ship wheel spinner, add favorites to unlock treasure chest icons, complete all achievements for full pirate mode. Each element is customizable - enable just the icons you like or go full pirate with language, sounds, and textures.
