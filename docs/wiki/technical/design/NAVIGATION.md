# Navigation System




> Navigate Revenge on any device

Navigation adapts to your device. Desktop uses a collapsible sidebar rail with module icons. Mobile gets a bottom navigation bar. TV apps use spatial navigation with D-pad support. Keyboard users get YouTube-style player shortcuts and a command palette (Ctrl+K) for quick access to anything.
