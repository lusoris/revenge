# Layout System




> Consistent spacing and responsive layouts

The layout system uses a 4px base unit for all spacing, ensuring visual consistency. Responsive breakpoints follow mobile-first design, scaling from 640px to 1536px. The grid system uses 4 columns on mobile, 8 on tablet, and 12 on desktop. Z-index layers keep modals, tooltips, and player controls properly stacked.
