# UI Components




> Reusable UI building blocks for Revenge

Component library built on shadcn-svelte and Bits UI. Media cards with hover info overlays, personalized hero banners, and hybrid episode lists. Vidstack powers the video player with minimal or full control layouts. Forms use outlined inputs with inline validation. Modals adapt to context - bottom sheets on mobile, center dialogs on desktop.
