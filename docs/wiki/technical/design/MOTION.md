# Motion & Animation




> Animations that delight without distracting

Motion in Revenge is expressive but purposeful. Cards scale on hover, overlays fade in smoothly, and success actions get subtle celebratory feedback. Loading uses skeleton previews with shimmer effects, transitioning to blurhash for images. All animations respect the prefers-reduced-motion setting for accessibility.
