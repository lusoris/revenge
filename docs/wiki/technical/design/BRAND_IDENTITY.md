# Brand Identity

> The visual identity behind Revenge

Revenge takes its name and visual identity from Queen Anne's Revenge - Blackbeard's legendary pirate ship. The brand balances sleek, professional design inspired by Netflix and Apple TV+ with subtle nautical elegance. The logo features a stylized ship silhouette. Pirate theming remains contextual - elegant gold accents in the main UI, with stronger theming available through unlockable easter eggs.
