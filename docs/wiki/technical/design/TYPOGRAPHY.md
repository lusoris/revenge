# Typography




> Inter for clarity, Playfair for elegance

Typography in Revenge uses a modern + serif accent approach. Inter handles all body text, UI elements, and navigation for maximum readability. Playfair Display adds elegant serif styling to movie titles, hero text, and section headers - fitting the Queen Anne's Revenge theme. The type scale uses a 1.25 modular ratio from a 16px base.
