# Webhooks




> Real-time event integration with external services

The Webhook System enables bidirectional event-driven integration. Receive webhooks from Arr services (Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, Whisparr) to automatically sync new downloads and metadata updates. Send webhooks to Discord, Slack, or custom endpoints for notifications and automation. All webhooks use HMAC signatures for security and are queued via River for reliable delivery with automatic retries.
