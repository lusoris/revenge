# API Reference




> Developer API reference for building custom clients


The Revenge API lets you build custom clients and integrations. All endpoints use REST conventions with JSON request/response bodies. Authentication uses JWT tokens (for users) or API keys (for services). The API follows OpenAPI 3.1 specification - you can view the full spec at /api/openapi.json. Rate limiting protects the server from overload. Errors use RFC 7807 Problem Details format for consistent error handling across all endpoints.
