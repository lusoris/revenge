# Notifications System




> Stay informed with email, push, and webhook notifications

The Notifications System delivers real-time alerts across multiple channels. Users receive email notifications for account updates, push notifications on mobile devices via Firebase Cloud Messaging, and developers can subscribe to webhooks for automation. The system queues all notifications via River for reliable delivery with automatic retries and respects user preferences for each notification type.
