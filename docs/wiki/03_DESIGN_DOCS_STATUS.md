# Design Documentation Status




> Progress dashboard for all design documents

This dashboard shows the completion status of all design documentation. Each document is tracked across multiple dimensions: design completeness, external sources, implementation status, and test coverage. Use this to identify gaps in documentation and prioritize work. Status indicators show complete, in-progress, and not-started states.
