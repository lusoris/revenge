# SyncPlay (Watch Together)

> Synchronized playback for multiple users watching together

Watch movies and shows together with friends, even when apart. SyncPlay keeps everyone at the same playback position in real-time via WebSocket. Create a room, share the link, and playback syncs automatically. Pause/play/seek actions sync to all participants. Built-in chat for commentary during viewing.
