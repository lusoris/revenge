# Skip Intro / Credits Detection




# Skip Intro / Credits Detection

> Automatic intro and credits detection with one-click skip

Skip repetitive intros and credits with one click. Revenge automatically detects intro sequences using audio fingerprinting (Chromaprint) and visual analysis. When an intro is detected, a Skip button appears. Enable auto-skip to jump automatically. Credits detection suggests the next episode before the current one ends.
