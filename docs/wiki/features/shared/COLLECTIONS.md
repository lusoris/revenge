# Collections & Playlists




# Collections & Playlists

> Organize your media with custom collections and playlists


The Collections system lets you group any media into custom collections. Create manual collections by hand-picking items, or smart collections that automatically update based on filters. Mix and match movies, TV shows, albums, and more in a single collection. Share collections publicly or collaborate with other users. Perfect for creating themed collections like "Best of 2023", "Oscar Winners", or "Workout Music".
