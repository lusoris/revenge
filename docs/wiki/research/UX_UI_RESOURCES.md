# UX/UI Design & Frontend Resources




> Design resources for building the Revenge UI

This document collects UI/UX resources used in designing Revenge. The component library builds on shadcn-svelte with Bits UI primitives for accessibility. Styling uses Tailwind CSS 4 with CSS variables for theme customization. Motion design follows modern streaming apps with smooth transitions. All components support keyboard navigation and screen readers. Design inspiration comes from Netflix, Disney+, and Plex interfaces.
