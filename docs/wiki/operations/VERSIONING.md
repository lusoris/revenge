# Semantic Versioning & Releases




> How version numbers work and when releases happen

Revenge follows Semantic Versioning (semver). Version numbers are formatted as vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. MAJOR bumps indicate breaking changes, MINOR adds new features without breaking existing functionality, and PATCH is for bug fixes. Releases are automated via Release Please - when commits merge to main, a release PR is created automatically with updated changelog. Pre-release versions (alpha, beta, rc) are used for testing before stable releases.
