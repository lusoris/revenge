# Development Environment Setup




> Get your local development environment running in minutes


This guide walks you through setting up Revenge for local development. You will install the required tools (Go 1.25+, Node.js 20, PostgreSQL 18), configure the database, and start the development servers with hot reload. The backend uses air for instant rebuilds on code changes, while the frontend uses Vite for blazing-fast HMR. Includes troubleshooting tips for common issues and useful Makefile commands to streamline your workflow.
