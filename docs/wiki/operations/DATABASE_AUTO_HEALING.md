# Database Auto-Healing & Recovery




> How Revenge automatically recovers from database issues

Revenge includes built-in database recovery mechanisms. The connection pool (pgxpool) automatically reconnects after network interruptions. Health checks run periodically with exponential backoff on failures. If the database becomes unavailable, Revenge enters a degraded read-only mode using cached data. Database migrations run automatically on startup, and daily backups can be configured for disaster recovery.
