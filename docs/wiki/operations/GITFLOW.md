# Git Workflow & Branching Strategy




> How we use Git branches for features, releases, and hotfixes

Revenge uses a Gitflow-style branching strategy. The main branch contains production-ready code, while develop is the integration branch for the next release. Create feature/* branches for new work, fix/* for bug fixes. All merges require pull request review. Commits follow Conventional Commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:) for automatic changelog generation. Git hooks enforce commit message format and run linters before push.
