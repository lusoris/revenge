# Grants Service




# Grants Service

> Polymorphic resource access grants for fine-grained sharing

The Grants service enables sharing specific items with other users. Share a movie, playlist, or library with friends without giving them full access. Grants can be time-limited (expires in 7 days) or permanent. Revoke access anytime. Works with all resource types through polymorphic references.
