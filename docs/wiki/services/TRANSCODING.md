# Transcoding Service




# Transcoding Service

> High-performance media transcoding with hardware acceleration

The Transcoding Service converts media files on-demand to ensure compatibility across all devices. Primary transcoding offloads to Blackbeard service for maximum performance, with local FFmpeg fallback. Hardware acceleration via NVENC, QSV, or VAAPI dramatically reduces CPU usage. Generates HLS adaptive streams with multiple quality levels, caching results for faster subsequent playback.
