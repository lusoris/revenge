# Blackbeard




> Blackbeard - External transcoding offloading

EXTERNAL transcoding service integration. Blackbeard is a **third-party distributed transcoding service** (not developed by us) that Revenge can optionally integrate with to offload CPU/GPU-intensive video processing. Revenge has **INTERNAL basic transcoding** via go-astiav/FFmpeg bindings. Blackbeard integration is OPTIONAL for users who want dedicated transcoding hardware. Further implementation details will be provided by Blackbeard project.
