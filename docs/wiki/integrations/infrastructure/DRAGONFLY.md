# Dragonfly

> Fast distributed caching with Dragonfly

Dragonfly provides high-speed caching for Revenge. Stores session data, API responses, and frequently accessed metadata in memory. Redis-compatible so existing tools work. Dramatically faster than Redis with lower memory usage. Required for multi-server deployments, optional but recommended for single-server.
