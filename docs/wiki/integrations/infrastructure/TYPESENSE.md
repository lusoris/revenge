# Typesense




# Typesense

> Instant search with typo tolerance

Typesense powers the search functionality in Revenge. Search results appear instantly as you type. Typo-tolerant so misspellings still find the right content. Faceted search lets you filter by genre, year, rating, and more. Automatically indexes new content as it is added to your library.
