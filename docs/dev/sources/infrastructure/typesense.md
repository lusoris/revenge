# # Typesense Documentation

Copy Markdown [ ](/docs/README.md "View raw markdown")

ð Welcome! Let's get you up and searching.

The documentation is divided into the following sections, that you'll find links for on the **top navigation bar** as well.

Section | Purpose  
---|---  
[**Overview**](/docs/overview/what-is-typesense.html) | This section gives you a birds-eye view of Typesense, why you'd want to use it and comparison with alternatives.  
[**Guide**](/docs/guide/) | This section walks you step-by-step through how you can use Typesense in different scenarios.  
[**API Reference**](/docs/30.1/api/) | This section gives you detailed information about all the API endpoints and parameters in each version of Typesense. When you're viewing any of the versions, you can click on the version dropdown in the Navbar to switch between versions.
