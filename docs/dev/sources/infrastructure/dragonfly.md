## About Dragonfly​

Dragonfly is a modern in-memory datastore, fully compatible with Redis and Memcached APIs. Dragonfly implements novel algorithms and data structures on top of a multi-threaded, shared-nothing architecture. As a result, Dragonfly reaches 25X performance compared to Redis and supports millions of QPS on a single instance.

Dragonfly is fully compatible with the Redis ecosystem and requires no code changes to implement.

Visit the [getting started section](/docs/getting-started) to explore deployment options and try Dragonfly yourself.
