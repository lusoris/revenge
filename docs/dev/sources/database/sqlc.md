And lo, the Great One looked down upon the people and proclaimed:

“SQL is actually pretty great”

sqlc generates

fully type-safe idiomatic Go code

from SQL. Here’s how it
works:

You write SQL queries

You run sqlc to generate Go code that presents type-safe interfaces to those
queries

You write application code that calls the methods sqlc generated

Seriously, it’s that easy. You don’t have to write any boilerplate SQL querying
code ever again.
