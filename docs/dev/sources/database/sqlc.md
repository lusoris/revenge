sqlc generates **fully type-safe idiomatic Go code** from SQL. Here’s how it works:

  1. You write SQL queries

  2. You run sqlc to generate Go code that presents type-safe interfaces to those queries

  3. You write application code that calls the methods sqlc generated

Seriously, it’s that easy. You don’t have to write any boilerplate SQL querying code ever again.
