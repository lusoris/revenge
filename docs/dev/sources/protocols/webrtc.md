WebRTC API
WebRTC
(Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that comprise WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any other third-party software.
WebRTC consists of several interrelated APIs and protocols which work together to achieve this. The documentation you'll find here will help you understand the fundamentals of WebRTC, how to set up and use both data and media connections, and more.

WebRTC concepts and usage
WebRTC serves multiple purposes; together with the
Media Capture and Streams API
, they provide powerful multimedia capabilities to the Web, including support for audio and video conferencing, file exchange, screen sharing, identity management, and interfacing with legacy telephone systems including support for sending
DTMF
(touch-tone dialing) signals. Connections between peers can be made without requiring any special drivers or plug-ins, and can often be made without any intermediary servers.
Connections between two peers are represented by the
RTCPeerConnection
interface. Once a connection has been established and opened using
RTCPeerConnection
, media streams (
MediaStream
s) and/or data channels (
RTCDataChannel
s) can be added to the connection.
Media streams can consist of any number of tracks of media information; tracks, which are represented by objects based on the
MediaStreamTrack
interface, may contain one of a number of types of media data, including audio, video, and text (such as subtitles or even chapter names). Most streams consist of at least one audio track and likely also a video track, and can be used to send and receive both live media or stored media information (such as a streamed movie).
You can also use the connection between two peers to exchange arbitrary binary data using the
RTCDataChannel
interface. This can be used for back-channel information, metadata exchange, game status packets, file transfers, or even as a primary channel for data transfer.
Interoperability
WebRTC is in general well supported in modern browsers, but some incompatibilities remain. The
adapter.js
library is a shim to insulate apps from these incompatibilities.
WebRTC reference
Because WebRTC provides interfaces that work together to accomplish a variety of tasks, we have divided up the reference by category. Please see the sidebar for an alphabetical list.
Connection setup and management
These interfaces, dictionaries, and types are used to set up, open, and manage WebRTC connections. Included are interfaces representing peer media connections, data channels, and interfaces used when exchanging information on the capabilities of each peer in order to select the best possible configuration for a two-way media connection.
Interfaces
RTCPeerConnection
Represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It is used to handle efficient streaming of data between the two peers.
RTCDataChannel
Represents a bi-directional data channel between two peers of a connection.

Represents events that occur while attaching a
RTCDataChannel
to a
RTCPeerConnection
. The only event sent with this interface is
datachannel

RTCSessionDescription
consists of a description
type
indicating which part of the offer/answer negotiation process it describes and of the
SDP
descriptor of the session.

ICE
) server for establishing an
RTCPeerConnection
.

Introduction to the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), defined in
RFC 3550
, is an IETF standard protocol to enable real-time connectivity for exchanging data that needs real-time priority. This article provides an overview of what RTP is and how it functions in the context of WebRTC.

Lifetime of a WebRTC session
WebRTC lets you build peer-to-peer communication of arbitrary data, audio, or videoâor any combination thereofâinto a browser application. In this article, we'll look at the lifetime of a WebRTC session, from establishing the connection all the way through closing the connection when it's no longer needed.
Establishing a connection: The perfect negotiation pattern
Perfect negotiation
is a design pattern which is recommended for your signaling process to follow, which provides transparency in negotiation while allowing both sides to be either the offerer or the answerer, without significant coding needed to differentiate the two.

Tutorials
Improving compatibility using WebRTC adapter.js
The WebRTC organization
provides on GitHub the WebRTC adapter
to work around compatibility issues in different browsers' WebRTC implementations. The adapter is a JavaScript shim which lets your code to be written to the specification so that it will "just work" in all browsers with WebRTC support.
A simple RTCDataChannel sample
The
RTCDataChannel
interface is a feature which lets you open a channel between two peers over which you may send and receive arbitrary data. The API is intentionally similar to the
WebSocket API
, so that the same programming model can be used for each.
