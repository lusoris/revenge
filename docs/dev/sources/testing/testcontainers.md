About Testcontainers for Go

¶

Testcontainers for Go

is a Go package that makes it simple to create and clean up container-based dependencies for
automated integration/smoke tests. The clean, easy-to-use API enables developers to programmatically define containers
that should be run as part of a test and clean up those resources when the test is done.

To start using

Testcontainers for Go

quickstart guide
