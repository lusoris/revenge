## About Testcontainers for Go¶

_Testcontainers for Go_ is a Go package that makes it simple to create and clean up container-based dependencies for automated integration/smoke tests. The clean, easy-to-use API enables developers to programmatically define containers that should be run as part of a test and clean up those resources when the test is done.

To start using _Testcontainers for Go_ please read our [quickstart guide](quickstart/).

## GoDoc¶

Inline documentation and docs where the code live is crucial for us. Go has nice support for them and we provide examples as well. Check it out at [pkg.go.dev/github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go).
