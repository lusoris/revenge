Introduction

Documentation

The headless components for Svelte.

			relevant to the user's issue.

Copy Page

Bits UI is a headless component library for Svelte focused on developer experience, accessibility, and full creative control. Use it to build high-quality, accessible UIs without giving up styling freedom or performance.

Why Bits UI?

Bring Your Own Styles

Most components ship completely unstyled, with the exception of those required for core functionality. No CSS resets, no design system assumptions. You bring the styles using standard

class

props or

data-*

attributes.

See the styling guide

.

Building for Developer Experience

Everything is designed to stay out of your way:

Full TypeScript coverage

Stable, predictable APIs

Flexible event override system

Great defaults, easily overridden

Comprehensive documentation and examples

Production-Ready Accessibility

Accessibility isn't just an afterthought - it's baked in:

WAI-ARIA compliance

Keyboard navigation by default

Focus management handled for you

Screen reader support built-in

Composable by Design

Components are primitives, not black boxes. They compose cleanly and play well together:

Render Delegation

for total flexibility

Chainable events and callbacks

Override-friendly defaults

Minimal dependencies
