# Superforms ð¥

#### ð Svelte Hack 2023 winner - Best library! ð

Superforms is a SvelteKit form library that brings you a comprehensive solution for **server and client form validation**. It supports a multitude of validation libraries:

[Arktype](/get-started/arktype) [class-validator](/get-started/class-validator) [Effect](/get-started/effect) [Joi](/get-started/joi) [JSON Schema](/get-started/json-schema) [Superstruct](/get-started/superstruct) [TypeBox](/get-started/typebox) [Valibot](/get-started/valibot) [VineJS](/get-started/@vinejs/vine) [Yup](/get-started/yup) [Zod](/get-started/zod4)

Pick your favorite, Superforms takes care of the rest with consistent handling of form data and validation errors, with full type safety. It works with both TypeScript and JavaScript, even in static and single-page apps.

The API is minimal, basically a single method on the server and client, but itâs very flexible and configurable to handle every possible case of:

Nested data Multiple forms on the same page Tainted fields Client-side validation Loading spinners All in a minimal API
