Getting Started

Using Vite

Installation

Get started with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime.

Installing Tailwind CSS as a Vite plugin

Installing Tailwind CSS as a Vite plugin is the most seamless way to integrate it with frameworks like Laravel, SvelteKit, React Router, Nuxt, and SolidJS.

01

Create your project

Start by creating a new Vite project if you don’t have one set up already. The most common approach is to use

Create Vite

.

Terminal

npm

create

vite@latest

my-project

cd

my-project

02

Install Tailwind CSS

Install

tailwindcss

and

@tailwindcss/vite

via npm.

Terminal

npm

install

tailwindcss

@tailwindcss/vite

03

Configure the Vite plugin

Add the

@tailwindcss/vite

plugin to your Vite configuration.

vite.config.ts

import

{

defineConfig

}

from

'vite'

import

tailwindcss

from

'@tailwindcss/vite'

export

default

defineConfig

(

{

plugins

:

[

tailwindcss

()

,

]

,

}

)

04

Import Tailwind CSS

Add an

@import

to your CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS.

CSS

@import

"tailwindcss"

;

05

Start your build process

Run your build process with

npm run dev

or whatever command is configured in your

package.json

file.

Terminal

npm

run

dev

06

Start using Tailwind in your HTML

Make sure your compiled CSS is included in the

<head>

(your framework might handle this for you)

, then start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.
