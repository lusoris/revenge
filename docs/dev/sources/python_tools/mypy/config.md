# The mypy configuration file¶

Mypy is very configurable. This is most useful when introducing typing to an existing codebase. See [Using mypy with an existing codebase](existing_code.html#existing-code) for concrete advice for that situation.

Mypy supports reading configuration settings from a file. By default, mypy will discover configuration files by walking up the file system (up until the root of a repository or the root of the filesystem). In each directory, it will look for the following configuration files (in this order):

>   1. `mypy.ini`
> 
>   2. `.mypy.ini`
> 
>   3. `pyproject.toml` (containing a `[tool.mypy]` section)
> 
>   4. `setup.cfg` (containing a `[mypy]` section)
> 
> 


If no configuration file is found by this method, mypy will then look for configuration files in the following locations (in this order):

>   1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mypy/config`
> 
>   2. `~/.config/mypy/config`
> 
>   3. `~/.mypy.ini`
> 
> 


The [`\--config-file`](command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-config-file) command-line flag has the highest precedence and must point towards a valid configuration file; otherwise mypy will report an error and exit. Without the command line option, mypy will look for configuration files in the precedence order above.

It is important to understand that there is no merging of configuration files, as it would lead to ambiguity.

Most flags correspond closely to [command-line flags](command_line.html#command-line) but there are some differences in flag names and some flags may take a different value based on the module being processed.

Some flags support user home directory and environment variable expansion. To refer to the user home directory, use `~` at the beginning of the path. To expand environment variables use `$VARNAME` or `${VARNAME}`.

## Config file format¶

The configuration file format is the usual [ini file](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html "\(in Python v3.14\)") format. It should contain section names in square brackets and flag settings of the form NAME = VALUE. Comments start with `#` characters.

  * A section named `[mypy]` must be present. This specifies the global flags.

  * Additional sections named `[mypy-PATTERN1,PATTERN2,...]` may be present, where `PATTERN1`, `PATTERN2`, etc., are comma-separated patterns of fully-qualified module names, with some components optionally replaced by the ‘*’ character (e.g. `foo.bar`, `foo.bar.*`, `foo.*.baz`). These sections specify additional flags that only apply to _modules_ whose name matches at least one of the patterns.

A pattern of the form `qualified_module_name` matches only the named module, while `dotted_module_name.*` matches `dotted_module_name` and any submodules (so `foo.bar.*` would match all of `foo.bar`, `foo.bar.baz`, and `foo.bar.baz.quux`).

Patterns may also be “unstructured” wildcards, in which stars may appear in the middle of a name (e.g `site.*.migrations.*`). Stars match zero or more module components (so `site.*.migrations.*` can match `site.migrations`).

When options conflict, the precedence order for configuration is:

>     1. [Inline configuration](inline_config.html#inline-config) in the source file
> 
>     2. Sections with concrete module names (`foo.bar`)
> 
>     3. Sections with “unstructured” wildcard patterns (`foo.*.baz`), with sections later in the configuration file overriding sections earlier.
> 
>     4. Sections with “well-structured” wildcard patterns (`foo.bar.*`), with more specific overriding more general.
> 
>     5. Command line options.
> 
>     6. Top-level configuration file options.




The difference in precedence order between “structured” patterns (by specificity) and “unstructured” patterns (by order in the file) is unfortunate, and is subject to change in future versions.

Note

The `warn_unused_configs` flag may be useful to debug misspelled section names.

Note

Configuration flags are liable to change between releases.

## Per-module and global options¶

Some of the config options may be set either globally (in the `[mypy]` section) or on a per-module basis (in sections like `[mypy-foo.bar]`).

If you set an option both globally and for a specific module, the module configuration options take precedence. This lets you set global defaults and override them on a module-by-module basis. If multiple pattern sections match a module, the options from the most specific section are used where they disagree.

Some other options, as specified in their description, may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

## Inverting option values¶

Options that take a boolean value may be inverted by adding `no_` to their name or by (when applicable) swapping their prefix from `disallow` to `allow` (and vice versa).

## Example `mypy.ini`¶

Here is an example of a `mypy.ini` file. To use this config file, place it at the root of your repo and run mypy.
    
    
    # Global options:
    
    [mypy]
    warn_return_any = True
    warn_unused_configs = True
    
    # Per-module options:
    
    [mypy-mycode.foo.*]
    disallow_untyped_defs = True
    
    [mypy-mycode.bar]
    warn_return_any = False
    
    [mypy-somelibrary]
    ignore_missing_imports = True
    

This config file specifies two global options in the `[mypy]` section. These two options will:

  1. Report an error whenever a function returns a value that is inferred to have type `Any`.

  2. Report any config options that are unused by mypy. (This will help us catch typos when making changes to our config file).




Next, this module specifies three per-module options. The first two options change how mypy type checks code in `mycode.foo.*` and `mycode.bar`, which we assume here are two modules that you wrote. The final config option changes how mypy type checks `somelibrary`, which we assume here is some 3rd party library you’ve installed and are importing. These options will:

  1. Selectively disallow untyped function definitions only within the `mycode.foo` package – that is, only for function definitions defined in the `mycode/foo` directory.

  2. Selectively _disable_ the “function is returning any” warnings within `mycode.bar` only. This overrides the global default we set earlier.

  3. Suppress any error messages generated when your codebase tries importing the module `somelibrary`. This is useful if `somelibrary` is some 3rd party library missing type hints.




## Import discovery¶

For more information, see the [Import discovery](command_line.html#import-discovery) section of the command line docs.

mypy_path¶
    

Type:
    

string

Specifies the paths to use, after trying the paths from `MYPYPATH` environment variable. Useful if you’d like to keep stubs in your repo, along with the config file. Multiple paths are always separated with a `:` or `,` regardless of the platform. User home directory and environment variables will be expanded.

Relative paths are treated relative to the working directory of the mypy command, not the config file. Use the `MYPY_CONFIG_FILE_DIR` environment variable to refer to paths relative to the config file (e.g. `mypy_path = $MYPY_CONFIG_FILE_DIR/src`).

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

**Note:** On Windows, use UNC paths to avoid using `:` (e.g. `\\\127.0.0.1\X$\MyDir` where `X` is the drive letter).

files¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

A comma-separated list of paths which should be checked by mypy if none are given on the command line. Supports recursive file globbing using [`glob`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#module-glob "\(in Python v3.14\)"), where `*` (e.g. `*.py`) matches files in the current directory and `**/` (e.g. `**/*.py`) matches files in any directories below the current one. User home directory and environment variables will be expanded.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

modules¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

A comma-separated list of packages which should be checked by mypy if none are given on the command line. Mypy _will not_ recursively type check any submodules of the provided module.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

packages¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

A comma-separated list of packages which should be checked by mypy if none are given on the command line. Mypy _will_ recursively type check any submodules of the provided package. This flag is identical to `modules` apart from this behavior.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

exclude¶
    

Type:
    

regular expression

A regular expression that matches file names, directory names and paths which mypy should ignore while recursively discovering files to check. Use forward slashes (`/`) as directory separators on all platforms.
    
    
    [mypy]
    exclude = (?x)(
        ^one\.py$    # files named "one.py"
        | two\.pyi$  # or files ending with "two.pyi"
        | ^three\.   # or files starting with "three."
      )
    

Crafting a single regular expression that excludes multiple files while remaining human-readable can be a challenge. The above example demonstrates one approach. `(?x)` enables the `VERBOSE` flag for the subsequent regular expression, which [`ignores most whitespace and supports comments`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.VERBOSE "\(in Python v3.14\)"). The above is equivalent to: `(^one\\.py$|two\\.pyi$|^three\\.)`.

For more details, see [`\--exclude`](command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-exclude).

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

Note

Note that the TOML equivalent differs slightly. It can be either a single string (including a multi-line string) – which is treated as a single regular expression – or an array of such strings. The following TOML examples are equivalent to the above INI example.

Array of strings:
    
    
    [tool.mypy]
    exclude = [
        "^one\\.py$",  # TOML's double-quoted strings require escaping backslashes
        'two\.pyi$',  # but TOML's single-quoted strings do not
        '^three\.',
    ]
    

A single, multi-line string:
    
    
    [tool.mypy]
    exclude = '''(?x)(
        ^one\.py$    # files named "one.py"
        | two\.pyi$  # or files ending with "two.pyi"
        | ^three\.   # or files starting with "three."
    )'''  # TOML's single-quoted strings do not require escaping backslashes
    

See Using a pyproject.toml file.

exclude_gitignore¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

This flag will add everything that matches `.gitignore` file(s) to `exclude`. This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

namespace_packages¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

True

Enables [**PEP 420**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/) style namespace packages. See the corresponding flag [`\--no-namespace-packages`](command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-no-namespace-packages) for more information.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

explicit_package_bases¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

This flag tells mypy that top-level packages will be based in either the current directory, or a member of the `MYPYPATH` environment variable or `mypy_path` config option. This option is only useful in the absence of __init__.py. See [Mapping file paths to modules](running_mypy.html#mapping-paths-to-modules) for details.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

ignore_missing_imports¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Suppresses error messages about imports that cannot be resolved.

If this option is used in a per-module section, the module name should match the name of the _imported_ module, not the module containing the import statement.

follow_untyped_imports¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Makes mypy analyze imports from installed packages even if missing a [py.typed marker or stubs](installed_packages.html#installed-packages).

If this option is used in a per-module section, the module name should match the name of the _imported_ module, not the module containing the import statement.

Warning

Note that analyzing all unannotated modules might result in issues when analyzing code not designed to be type checked and may significantly increase how long mypy takes to run.

follow_imports¶
    

Type:
    

string

Default:
    

`normal`

Directs what to do with imports when the imported module is found as a `.py` file and not part of the files, modules and packages provided on the command line.

The four possible values are `normal`, `silent`, `skip` and `error`. For explanations see the discussion for the [`\--follow-imports`](command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-follow-imports) command line flag.

Using this option in a per-module section (potentially with a wildcard, as described at the top of this page) is a good way to prevent mypy from checking portions of your code.

If this option is used in a per-module section, the module name should match the name of the _imported_ module, not the module containing the import statement.

follow_imports_for_stubs¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Determines whether to respect the `follow_imports` setting even for stub (`.pyi`) files.

Used in conjunction with `follow_imports=skip`, this can be used to suppress the import of a module from `typeshed`, replacing it with `Any`.

Used in conjunction with `follow_imports=error`, this can be used to make any use of a particular `typeshed` module an error.

Note

This is not supported by the mypy daemon.

python_executable¶
    

Type:
    

string

Specifies the path to the Python executable to inspect to collect a list of available [PEP 561 packages](installed_packages.html#installed-packages). User home directory and environment variables will be expanded. Defaults to the executable used to run mypy.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

no_site_packages¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disables using type information in installed packages (see [**PEP 561**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)). This will also disable searching for a usable Python executable. This acts the same as [`\--no-site-packages`](command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-no-site-packages) command line flag.

no_silence_site_packages¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Enables reporting error messages generated within installed packages (see [**PEP 561**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) for more details on distributing type information). Those error messages are suppressed by default, since you are usually not able to control errors in 3rd party code.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

## Platform configuration¶

python_version¶
    

Type:
    

string

Specifies the Python version used to parse and check the target program. The string should be in the format `MAJOR.MINOR` – for example `3.9`. The default is the version of the Python interpreter used to run mypy.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

platform¶
    

Type:
    

string

Specifies the OS platform for the target program, for example `darwin` or `win32` (meaning OS X or Windows, respectively). The default is the current platform as revealed by Python’s [`sys.platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform "\(in Python v3.14\)") variable.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

always_true¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

Specifies a list of variables that mypy will treat as compile-time constants that are always true.

always_false¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

Specifies a list of variables that mypy will treat as compile-time constants that are always false.

## Disallow dynamic typing¶

For more information, see the [Disallow dynamic typing](command_line.html#disallow-dynamic-typing) section of the command line docs.

disallow_any_unimported¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows usage of types that come from unfollowed imports (anything imported from an unfollowed import is automatically given a type of `Any`).

disallow_any_expr¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows all expressions in the module that have type `Any`.

disallow_any_decorated¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows functions that have `Any` in their signature after decorator transformation.

disallow_any_explicit¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows explicit `Any` in type positions such as type annotations and generic type parameters.

disallow_any_generics¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows usage of generic types that do not specify explicit type parameters.

disallow_subclassing_any¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows subclassing a value of type `Any`.

## Untyped definitions and calls¶

For more information, see the [Untyped definitions and calls](command_line.html#untyped-definitions-and-calls) section of the command line docs.

disallow_untyped_calls¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows calling functions without type annotations from functions with type annotations. Note that when used in per-module options, it enables/disables this check **inside** the module(s) specified, not for functions that come from that module(s), for example config like this:
    
    
    [mypy]
    disallow_untyped_calls = True
    
    [mypy-some.library.*]
    disallow_untyped_calls = False
    

will disable this check inside `some.library`, not for your code that imports `some.library`. If you want to selectively disable this check for all your code that imports `some.library` you should instead use `untyped_calls_exclude`, for example:
    
    
    [mypy]
    disallow_untyped_calls = True
    untyped_calls_exclude = some.library
    

untyped_calls_exclude¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

Selectively excludes functions and methods defined in specific packages, modules, and classes from action of `disallow_untyped_calls`. This also applies to all submodules of packages (i.e. everything inside a given prefix). Note, this option does not support per-file configuration, the exclusions list is defined globally for all your code.

disallow_untyped_defs¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows defining functions without type annotations or with incomplete type annotations (a superset of `disallow_incomplete_defs`).

For example, it would report an error for `def f(a, b)` and `def f(a: int, b)`.

disallow_incomplete_defs¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows defining functions with incomplete type annotations, while still allowing entirely unannotated definitions.

For example, it would report an error for `def f(a: int, b)` but not `def f(a, b)`.

check_untyped_defs¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Type-checks the interior of functions without type annotations.

disallow_untyped_decorators¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Reports an error whenever a function with type annotations is decorated with a decorator without annotations.

## None and Optional handling¶

For more information, see the [None and Optional handling](command_line.html#none-and-optional-handling) section of the command line docs.

implicit_optional¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Causes mypy to treat parameters with a `None` default value as having an implicit optional type (`T | None`).

**Note:** This was True by default in mypy versions 0.980 and earlier.

strict_optional¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

True

Effectively disables checking of optional types and `None` values. With this option, mypy doesn’t generally check the use of `None` values – it is treated as compatible with every type.

Warning

`strict_optional = false` is evil. Avoid using it and definitely do not use it without understanding what it does.

## Configuring warnings¶

For more information, see the [Configuring warnings](command_line.html#configuring-warnings) section of the command line docs.

warn_redundant_casts¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Warns about casting an expression to its inferred type.

This option may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

warn_unused_ignores¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Warns about unneeded `# type: ignore` comments.

warn_no_return¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

True

Shows errors for missing return statements on some execution paths.

warn_return_any¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Shows a warning when returning a value with type `Any` from a function declared with a non- `Any` return type.

warn_unreachable¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Shows a warning when encountering any code inferred to be unreachable or redundant after performing type analysis.

deprecated_calls_exclude¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

Selectively excludes functions and methods defined in specific packages, modules, and classes from the [deprecated](error_code_list2.html#code-deprecated) error code. This also applies to all submodules of packages (i.e. everything inside a given prefix). Note, this option does not support per-file configuration, the exclusions list is defined globally for all your code.

## Suppressing errors¶

Note: these configuration options are available in the config file only. There is no analog available via the command line options.

ignore_errors¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Ignores all non-fatal errors.

## Miscellaneous strictness flags¶

For more information, see the [Miscellaneous strictness flags](command_line.html#miscellaneous-strictness-flags) section of the command line docs.

allow_untyped_globals¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Causes mypy to suppress errors caused by not being able to fully infer the types of global and class variables.

allow_redefinition_new¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

By default, mypy won’t allow a variable to be redefined with an unrelated type. This _experimental_ flag enables the redefinition of unannotated variables with an arbitrary type. You will also need to enable `local_partial_types`. Example:
    
    
    def maybe_convert(n: int, b: bool) -> int | str:
        if b:
            x = str(n)  # Assign "str"
        else:
            x = n       # Assign "int"
        # Type of "x" is "int | str" here.
        return x
    

This also enables an unannotated variable to have different types in different code locations:
    
    
    if check():
        for x in range(n):
            # Type of "x" is "int" here.
            ...
    else:
        for x in ['a', 'b']:
            # Type of "x" is "str" here.
            ...
    

Note: We are planning to turn this flag on by default in a future mypy release, along with `local_partial_types`.

allow_redefinition¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Allows variables to be redefined with an arbitrary type, as long as the redefinition is in the same block and nesting level as the original definition. Example where this can be useful:
    
    
    def process(items: list[str]) -> None:
        # 'items' has type list[str]
        items = [item.split() for item in items]
        # 'items' now has type list[list[str]]
    

The variable must be used before it can be redefined:
    
    
    def process(items: list[str]) -> None:
       items = "mypy"  # invalid redefinition to str because the variable hasn't been used yet
       print(items)
       items = "100"  # valid, items now has type str
       items = int(items)  # valid, items now has type int
    

local_partial_types¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disallows inferring variable type for `None` from two assignments in different scopes. This is always implicitly enabled when using the [mypy daemon](mypy_daemon.html#mypy-daemon). This will be enabled by default in a future mypy release.

disable_error_code¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

Allows disabling one or multiple error codes globally.

enable_error_code¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

Allows enabling one or multiple error codes globally.

Note: This option will override disabled error codes from the disable_error_code option.

extra_checks¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

This flag enables additional checks that are technically correct but may be impractical. See [`mypy \--extra-checks`](command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-extra-checks) for more info.

implicit_reexport¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

True

By default, imported values to a module are treated as exported and mypy allows other modules to import them. When false, mypy will not re-export unless the item is imported using from-as or is included in `__all__`. Note that mypy treats stub files as if this is always disabled. For example:
    
    
    # This won't re-export the value
    from foo import bar
    # This will re-export it as bar and allow other modules to import it
    from foo import bar as bar
    # This will also re-export bar
    from foo import bar
    __all__ = ['bar']
    

strict_equality¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Prohibit equality checks, identity checks, and container checks between non-overlapping types (except `None`).

strict_equality_for_none¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Include `None` in strict equality checks (requires `strict_equality` to be activated).

strict_bytes¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Disable treating `bytearray` and `memoryview` as subtypes of `bytes`. This will be enabled by default in _mypy 2.0_.

strict¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Enable all optional error checking flags. You can see the list of flags enabled by strict mode in the full [`mypy \--help`](command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-h) output.

Note: the exact list of flags enabled by `strict` may change over time.

## Configuring error messages¶

For more information, see the [Configuring error messages](command_line.html#configuring-error-messages) section of the command line docs.

These options may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

show_error_context¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Prefixes each error with the relevant context.

show_column_numbers¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Shows column numbers in error messages.

show_error_code_links¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Shows documentation link to corresponding error code.

hide_error_codes¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Hides error codes in error messages. See [Error codes](error_codes.html#error-codes) for more information.

pretty¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Use visually nicer output in error messages: use soft word wrap, show source code snippets, and show error location markers.

color_output¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

True

Shows error messages with color enabled.

error_summary¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

True

Shows a short summary line after error messages.

show_absolute_path¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Show absolute paths to files.

force_union_syntax¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Always use `Union[]` and `Optional[]` for union types in error messages (instead of the `|` operator), even on Python 3.10+.

## Incremental mode¶

These options may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

incremental¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

True

Enables [incremental mode](command_line.html#incremental).

cache_dir¶
    

Type:
    

string

Default:
    

`.mypy_cache`

Specifies the location where mypy stores incremental cache info. User home directory and environment variables will be expanded. This setting will be overridden by the `MYPY_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

Note that the cache is only read when incremental mode is enabled but is always written to, unless the value is set to `/dev/null` (UNIX) or `nul` (Windows).

sqlite_cache¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Use an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database to store the cache.

cache_fine_grained¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Include fine-grained dependency information in the cache for the mypy daemon.

skip_version_check¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Makes mypy use incremental cache data even if it was generated by a different version of mypy. (By default, mypy will perform a version check and regenerate the cache if it was written by older versions of mypy.)

skip_cache_mtime_checks¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Skip cache internal consistency checks based on mtime.

## Advanced options¶

These options may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

plugins¶
    

Type:
    

comma-separated list of strings

A comma-separated list of mypy plugins. See [Extending mypy using plugins](extending_mypy.html#extending-mypy-using-plugins).

pdb¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Invokes [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "\(in Python v3.14\)") on fatal error.

show_traceback¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Shows traceback on fatal error.

raise_exceptions¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Raise exception on fatal error.

custom_typing_module¶
    

Type:
    

string

Specifies a custom module to use as a substitute for the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing "\(in Python v3.14\)") module.

custom_typeshed_dir¶
    

Type:
    

string

This specifies the directory where mypy looks for standard library typeshed stubs, instead of the typeshed that ships with mypy. This is primarily intended to make it easier to test typeshed changes before submitting them upstream, but also allows you to use a forked version of typeshed.

User home directory and environment variables will be expanded.

Note that this doesn’t affect third-party library stubs. To test third-party stubs, for example try `MYPYPATH=stubs/six mypy ...`.

warn_incomplete_stub¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Warns about missing type annotations in typeshed. This is only relevant in combination with `disallow_untyped_defs` or `disallow_incomplete_defs`.

## Report generation¶

If these options are set, mypy will generate a report in the specified format into the specified directory.

Warning

Generating reports disables incremental mode and can significantly slow down your workflow. It is recommended to enable reporting only for specific runs (e.g. in CI).

any_exprs_report¶
    

Type:
    

string

Causes mypy to generate a text file report documenting how many expressions of type `Any` are present within your codebase.

cobertura_xml_report¶
    

Type:
    

string

Causes mypy to generate a Cobertura XML type checking coverage report.

To generate this report, you must either manually install the [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) library or specify mypy installation with the setuptools extra `mypy[reports]`.

html_report / xslt_html_report¶
    

Type:
    

string

Causes mypy to generate an HTML type checking coverage report.

To generate this report, you must either manually install the [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) library or specify mypy installation with the setuptools extra `mypy[reports]`.

linecount_report¶
    

Type:
    

string

Causes mypy to generate a text file report documenting the functions and lines that are typed and untyped within your codebase.

linecoverage_report¶
    

Type:
    

string

Causes mypy to generate a JSON file that maps each source file’s absolute filename to a list of line numbers that belong to typed functions in that file.

lineprecision_report¶
    

Type:
    

string

Causes mypy to generate a flat text file report with per-module statistics of how many lines are typechecked etc.

txt_report / xslt_txt_report¶
    

Type:
    

string

Causes mypy to generate a text file type checking coverage report.

To generate this report, you must either manually install the [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) library or specify mypy installation with the setuptools extra `mypy[reports]`.

xml_report¶
    

Type:
    

string

Causes mypy to generate an XML type checking coverage report.

To generate this report, you must either manually install the [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) library or specify mypy installation with the setuptools extra `mypy[reports]`.

## Miscellaneous¶

These options may only be set in the global section (`[mypy]`).

junit_xml¶
    

Type:
    

string

Causes mypy to generate a JUnit XML test result document with type checking results. This can make it easier to integrate mypy with continuous integration (CI) tools.

junit_format¶
    

Type:
    

string

Default:
    

`global`

If junit_xml is set, specifies format. global (default): single test with all errors; per_file: one test entry per file with failures.

scripts_are_modules¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Makes script `x` become module `x` instead of `__main__`. This is useful when checking multiple scripts in a single run.

warn_unused_configs¶
    

Type:
    

boolean

Default:
    

False

Warns about per-module sections in the config file that do not match any files processed when invoking mypy. (This requires turning off incremental mode using `incremental = False`.)

verbosity¶
    

Type:
    

integer

Default:
    

0

Controls how much debug output will be generated. Higher numbers are more verbose.

## Using a pyproject.toml file¶

Instead of using a `mypy.ini` file, a `pyproject.toml` file (as specified by [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/)) may be used instead. A few notes on doing so:

  * The `[mypy]` section should have `tool.` prepended to its name:

    * I.e., `[mypy]` would become `[tool.mypy]`

  * The module specific sections should be moved into `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` sections:

    * For example, `[mypy-packagename]` would become:



    
    
    [[tool.mypy.overrides]]
    module = 'packagename'
    ...
    

  * Multi-module specific sections can be moved into a single `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` section with a module property set to an array of modules:

    * For example, `[mypy-packagename,packagename2]` would become:



    
    
    [[tool.mypy.overrides]]
    module = [
        'packagename',
        'packagename2'
    ]
    ...
    

  * The following care should be given to values in the `pyproject.toml` files as compared to `ini` files:

    * Strings must be wrapped in double quotes, or single quotes if the string contains special characters

    * Boolean values should be all lower case




Please see the [TOML Documentation](https://toml.io/) for more details and information on what is allowed in a `toml` file. See [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) for more information on the layout and structure of the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Example `pyproject.toml`¶

Here is an example of a `pyproject.toml` file. To use this config file, place it at the root of your repo (or append it to the end of an existing `pyproject.toml` file) and run mypy.
    
    
    # mypy global options:
    
    [tool.mypy]
    python_version = "3.9"
    warn_return_any = true
    warn_unused_configs = true
    exclude = [
        '^file1\.py$',  # TOML literal string (single-quotes, no escaping necessary)
        "^file2\\.py$",  # TOML basic string (double-quotes, backslash and other characters need escaping)
    ]
    
    # mypy per-module options:
    
    [[tool.mypy.overrides]]
    module = "mycode.foo.*"
    disallow_untyped_defs = true
    
    [[tool.mypy.overrides]]
    module = "mycode.bar"
    warn_return_any = false
    
    [[tool.mypy.overrides]]
    module = [
        "somelibrary",
        "some_other_library"
    ]
    ignore_missing_imports = true
