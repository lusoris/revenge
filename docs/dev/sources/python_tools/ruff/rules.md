# Rules

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules** , many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8, isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule's origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8's `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you're just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start** : it catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

## Legend

🧪 The rule is unstable and is in ["preview"](../faq/#what-is-preview).  
⚠️ The rule has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  
❌ The rule has been removed only the documentation is available.  
🛠️ The rule is automatically fixable by the `\--fix` command-line option.

All rules not marked as preview, deprecated or removed are stable.

B031 | [reuse-of-groupby-generator](reuse-of-groupby-generator/) | Using the generator returned from `itertools.groupby()` more than once will do nothing on the second usage |
