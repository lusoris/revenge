## About¶

Commitizen is a powerful release management tool that helps teams maintain consistent and meaningful commit messages while automating version management.

### What Commitizen Does¶

By enforcing standardized commit conventions (defaulting to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)), Commitizen helps teams:

- Write clear, structured commit messages
- Automatically manage version numbers using semantic versioning
- Generate and maintain changelogs
- Streamline the release process

### Key Benefits¶

With just a simple `cz bump` command, Commitizen handles:

  1. **Version Management** : Automatically bumps version numbers and updates version files based on your commit history
  2. **Changelog Generation** : Creates and updates changelogs following the [Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
  3. **Commit Standardization** : Enforces consistent commit message formats across your team

This standardization makes your commit history more readable and meaningful, while the automation reduces manual work and potential errors in the release process.

### Features¶

- Interactive CLI for standardized commits with default [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) support
- Intelligent [version bumping](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/commands/bump/) using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Automatic [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) generation
- Built-in commit validation with pre-commit hooks
- [Customizable](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/customization/config_file/) commit rules and templates
- Multi-format version file support
- Custom rules and plugins via pip

## Getting Started¶

### Requirements¶

Before installing Commitizen, ensure you have:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) `3.10+`
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) `1.8.5.2+`

### Installation¶

#### Global Installation (Recommended)¶

The recommended way to install Commitizen is using [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/) or [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which ensures a clean, isolated installation:

**Using pipx:**

    # Install Commitizen
    pipx install commitizen
    
    # Keep it updated
    pipx upgrade commitizen
    

**Using uv:**

    # Install commitizen
    uv tool install commitizen
    
    # Keep it updated
    uv tool upgrade commitizen
    

**(For macOS users) Using Homebrew:**

    brew install commitizen
    

#### Project-Specific Installation¶

You can add Commitizen to your Python project using any of these package managers:

**Using pip:**

    pip install -U commitizen
    

**Using conda:**

    conda install -c conda-forge commitizen
    

**Using Poetry:**

    # For Poetry >= 1.2.0
    poetry add commitizen --group dev
    
    # For Poetry < 1.2.0
    poetry add commitizen --dev
    

**Using uv:**

    uv add --dev commitizen
    

**Using pdm:**

    pdm add -d commitizen
    

### Basic Commands¶

#### Initialize Commitizen¶

To get started, run the `cz init` command. This will guide you through the process of creating a configuration file with your preferred settings.

#### Create Commits¶

Create standardized commits using:

    cz commit
    # or use the shortcut
    cz c
    

To sign off your commits:

    cz commit -- --signoff
    # or use the shortcut
    cz commit -- -s
    

For more commit options, run `cz commit --help`.

#### Version Management¶

The most common command you'll use is:

    cz bump
    

This command:

- Bumps your project's version
- Creates a git tag
- Updates the changelog (if `update_changelog_on_bump` is enabled)
- Updates version files

You can customize:

- [Version files](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/commands/bump/#version_files)
- [Version scheme](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/commands/bump/#version_scheme)
- [Version provider](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/config/version_provider/)

For all available options, see the [bump command documentation](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/commands/bump/).

### Advanced Usage¶

#### Get Project Version¶

    # Get your project's version (instead of Commitizen's version)
    cz version -p
    # Preview changelog changes
    cz changelog --dry-run "$(cz version -p)"
    

This command is particularly useful for automation scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

For example, you can use the output of the command `cz changelog --dry-run "$(cz version -p)"` to notify your team about a new release in Slack.

#### Prek and Pre-commit Integration¶

Commitizen can automatically validate your commit messages using pre-commit hooks.

  1. Add to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

         ---
         repos:
           - repo: https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen
             rev: master  # Replace with latest tag
             hooks:
               - id: commitizen
               - id: commitizen-branch
                 stages: [pre-push]
         

  2. Install the hooks:

         prek install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-push
         

Hook | Recommended Stage  
---|---  
commitizen | commit-msg  
commitizen-branch | pre-push  
  
> **Note** : Replace `master` with the [latest tag](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen/tags) to avoid warnings. You can automatically update this with:
> 
> 
>     prek autoupdate
>     

For more details about commit validation, see the [check command documentation](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/commands/check/).

For more details, visit our [documentation site](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/).

## Setting up bash completion¶

Commitizen supports command-line completion through [argcomplete](https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/), which is automatically installed as a dependency. This feature provides intelligent auto-completion for all Commitizen commands and options.

### Supported Shells¶

- **Bash** : Full support
- **Zsh** : Limited support
- **Fish** : Limited support
- **Tcsh** : Limited support

### Installation Methods¶

#### Global Installation (Recommended)¶

If you installed Commitizen globally (e.g., using `pipx` or `brew`), you can enable global completion:

    # Enable global completion for all Python applications
    sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete
    

#### User-Specific Installation¶

For a user-specific installation that persists across sessions:

    # Add to your shell's startup file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc)
    register-python-argcomplete cz >> ~/.bashrc
    

#### Temporary Installation¶

For one-time activation in your current shell session:

    # Activate completion for current session only
    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete cz)"
    

### Verification¶

After installation, you can verify the completion is working by:

  1. Opening a new terminal session
  2. Typing `cz` followed by a space and pressing `TAB` twice
  3. You should see a list of available commands
