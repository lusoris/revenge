# Planning and tracking with Projects

Build adaptable projects to track your work on GitHub.

A project is an adaptable collection of items that you can view as a table, a kanban board, or a roadmap and that stays up-to-date with GitHub data. Your projects can track issues, pull requests, and ideas that you note down.

You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, and grouping issues and pull requests, visualize work with configurable charts, and add custom fields to track metadata specific to your team. Rather than enforcing a specific methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your team’s needs and processes.
