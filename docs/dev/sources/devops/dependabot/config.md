## In this article

This article provides reference information for the configuration options available in the `dependabot.yml` file. Use these options to customize how Dependabot monitors package ecosystems, schedules updates, and creates pull requests. For an overview of the `dependabot.yml` file and how it works, see [About the dependabot.yml file](/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/about-the-dependabot-yml-file).

All options marked with a  icon also change how Dependabot creates pull requests for security updates, except where `target-branch` is used.

### Required keys

Key| Location| Purpose  
---|---|---  
`version`| Top level| Dependabot configuration syntax to use. Always: `2`.  
`updates`| Top level| Section where you define each `package-ecosystem` to update.  
`package-ecosystem`| Under `updates`| Define a package manager to update.  
`directories` or `directory`| Under each `package-ecosystem` entry| Define the location of the manifest or other definition files to update.  
`schedule.interval`| Under each `package-ecosystem` entry| Define whether to look for version updates: `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly`.  
  
Optionally, you can also include a top-level `registries` key to define access details for private registries, see Top-level `registries` key.

    # Basic `dependabot.yml` file with
    # minimum configuration for two package managers
    
    version: 2
    updates:
      # Enable version updates for npm
      - package-ecosystem: "npm"
        # Look for `package.json` and `lock` files in the `root` directory
        directory: "/"
        # Check the npm registry for updates every day (weekdays)
        schedule:
          interval: "daily"
    
      # Enable version updates for Docker
      - package-ecosystem: "docker"
        # Look for a `Dockerfile` in the `root` directory
        directory: "/"
        # Check for updates once a week
        schedule:
          interval: "weekly"
    

For a real-world example of a `dependabot.yml` file, see [Dependabot's own configuration file](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml).

## `allow`

Use to define exactly which dependencies to maintain for a package ecosystem. Often used with the `ignore` option. For examples, see [Controlling which dependencies are updated by Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/controlling-dependencies-updated#allowing-specific-dependencies-to-be-updated).

Dependabot default behavior:

- All dependencies explicitly defined in a manifest are kept up to date by version updates.
- All dependencies defined in lock files with vulnerable dependencies are updated by security updates.

When `allow` is specified Dependabot uses the following process:

  1. Check for all explicitly **allowed** dependencies.

  2. Then filter out any **ignored** dependencies or versions.

If a dependency is matched by an `allow` and an `ignore` statement, then it is **ignored**.

Parameters| Purpose  
---|---  
`dependency-name`| Allow updates for dependencies with matching names, optionally using `*` to match zero or more characters.  
`dependency-type`| Allow updates for dependencies of specific types.  
  
### `dependency-name` (`allow`)

For most package managers, you should define a value that will match the dependency name specified in the lock or manifest file. A few systems have more complex requirements.

Package manager| Format required| Example  
---|---|---  
Gradle and Maven| `groupId:artifactId`| `org.kohsuke:github-api`  
Docker for image tags| The full name of the repository| For an image tag of `<account ID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/base/foo/bar/ruby:3.1.0-focal-jemalloc`, use `base/foo/bar/ruby`.  
  
### `dependency-type` (`allow`)

Dependency types| Supported by package managers| Allow updates  
---|---|---  
`direct`| All| All explicitly defined dependencies.  
`indirect`| `bundler`, `pip`, `composer`, `cargo`, `gomod`| Dependencies of direct dependencies (also known as sub-dependencies, or transitive dependencies).  
`all`| All| All explicitly defined dependencies. For `bundler`, `pip`, `composer`, `cargo`, `gomod`, also the dependencies of direct dependencies.  
`production`| `bundler`, `composer`, `mix`, `maven`, `npm`, `pip` (not all managers)| Only to dependencies defined by the package manager as production dependencies.  
`development`| `bundler`, `composer`, `mix`, `maven`, `npm`, `pip` (not all managers)| Only to dependencies defined by the package manager as development dependencies.  
  
## `assignees`

Specify individual assignees for all pull requests raised for a package ecosystem. For examples, see [Customizing Dependabot pull requests to fit your processes](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/customizing-dependabot-prs).

Dependabot default behavior:

- Pull requests are created without any assignees.

When `assignees` is defined:

- All pull requests for version updates are created with the chosen assignees.
- All pull requests for security updates are created with the chosen assignees, unless `target-branch` defines updates to a non-default branch.

Assignees must have write access to the repository. For organization-owned repositories, organization members with read access are also valid assignees.

## `commit-message`

Define the format for commit messages. Since the titles of pull requests are written based on commit messages, this setting also impacts the titles of pull requests. For examples, see [Customizing Dependabot pull requests to fit your processes](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/customizing-dependabot-prs).

Dependabot default behavior:

- Commit messages follow similar patterns to those detected in the repository.

When `commit-message` is defined:

- All commit messages follow the defined pattern.
- All commit messages follow the defined pattern, unless `target-branch` defines updates to a non-default branch.

Parameters| Purpose  
---|---  
`prefix`| Defines a prefix for all commit messages and pull request titles.  
`prefix-development`| On supported systems, defines a different prefix to use for commits that update dependencies in the Development dependency group.  
`include`| Follow the commit message prefix with additional information.  
  
Tip

When pull requests are raised for grouped updates, the branch name and pull request title are defined by the group `IDENTIFIER`, see `groups`.

### `prefix`

- Used for all commit messages unless `prefix-development` is also defined.
- Value can be up to 50 characters.
- Dependabot inserts a colon after the prefix before adding the main commit message when the value ends with a letter, number, closing parenthesis, or closing bracket.
- End the value with a whitespace character to stop a colon being added.

### `prefix-development`

Supported by: `bundler`, `composer`, `mix`, `maven`, `npm`, and `pip`.

- Used only for commit messages that update dependencies in the Development dependency group.
- Otherwise, the parameter behaves exactly as the `prefix` parameter.

### `include`

- Supports only the value `scope`
- When defined any prefix is followed by the type of dependencies updated in the commit: `deps` or `deps-dev`.

## `cooldown`

Defines a **cooldown period** for dependency updates, allowing updates to be delayed for a configurable number of days. The `cooldown` option is only available for _version_ updates, not _security_ updates.

This feature enables users to customize how often Dependabot generates new version updates, offering greater control over update frequency. For examples, see [Optimizing the creation of pull requests for Dependabot version updates](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/optimizing-pr-creation-version-updates#setting-up-a-cooldown-period-for-dependency-updates).

Dependabot default behavior:

- Check for updates according to the scheduled defined via `schedule.interval`.
- Consider all new versions **immediately** for updates.

When **`cooldown`** is defined:

  1. Dependabot checks for updates according to the defined `schedule.interval` settings.
  2. Dependabot checks for any cooldown settings.
  3. If a dependency’s new release falls within its cooldown period, Dependabot skips updating the version for that dependency.
  4. Dependencies without a cooldown period, or those past their cooldown period, are updated to the latest version as per the configured `versioning-strategy` setting.
  5. After a cooldown ends for a dependency, Dependabot resumes updating the dependency following the standard update strategy defined in `dependabot.yml`.

### **Configuration of`cooldown`**

You can specify the duration of the cooldown using the options below.

Parameter| Description  
---|---  
`default-days`| **Default cooldown period for dependencies** without specific rules (optional).  
`semver-major-days`| Cooldown period for **major version updates** (optional, applies only to package managers supporting SemVer).  
`semver-minor-days`| Cooldown period for **minor version updates** (optional, applies only to package managers supporting SemVer).  
`semver-patch-days`| Cooldown period for **patch version updates** (optional, applies only to package managers supporting SemVer).  
`include`| List of dependencies to **apply cooldown** (up to **150 items**). Supports wildcards (`*`).  
`exclude`| List of dependencies **excluded from cooldown** (up to **150 items**). Supports wildcards (`*`).  
  
The table below shows the package managers for which SemVer is supported.

Package manager| SemVer supported  
---|---  
Bazel|
Bundler|
Bun|
Cargo|
Composer|
Devcontainers|
Docker|
Docker Compose|
Dotnet SDK|
Elm|
GitHub Actions|
Gitsubmodule|
Gomod (Go Modules)|
Gradle|
Helm|
Hex (Hex)|
Julia|
Maven|
NPM and Yarn|
NuGet|
OpenTofu|
Pip|
Pub|
Swift|
Terraform|
UV|
  
Note

- If `semver-major-days`, `semver-minor-days`, or `semver-patch-days` are not defined, the `default-days` settings will take precedence for cooldown-based updates.
- The `exclude` list always take precedence over the `include` list. If a dependency is specified in both lists, it is **excluded from cooldown** and will be updated immediately.

## `directories` or `directory`

**Required option**. Use to define the location of the package manifests for each package manager (for example, the _package.json_ or _Gemfile_). Without this information Dependabot cannot create pull requests for version updates. For examples, see [Defining multiple locations for manifest files](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/controlling-dependencies-updated#defining-multiple-locations-for-manifest-files).

- Use `directory` to define a single directory of manifests.

- Use `directories` to define a list of multiple directories of manifests.

- Define directories relative to the root of the repository for most package managers.

- For GitHub Actions, use the value `/`. Dependabot will search the `/.github/workflows` directory, as well as the `action.yml/action.yaml` file from the root directory.

If you need to use more than one block in the configuration file to define updates for a single target branch of an ecosystem, you must ensure that all values are unique and there is no overlap in directories defined.

Note

The `directories` key supports globbing and the wildcard character `*`. These features are not supported by the `directory` key.

## `enable-beta-ecosystems`

Not currently in use.

## `groups`

Define rules to create one or more sets of dependencies managed by a package manager, to group updates into fewer, targeted pull requests. For examples, see [Optimizing the creation of pull requests for Dependabot version updates](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/optimizing-pr-creation-version-updates).

Dependabot default behavior:

- Open a single pull request for each dependency that needs to be updated to a newer version for version updates and for security updates.

When `groups` is used to define rules:

- All updates for dependencies that match a rule are combined in a single pull request.
- If a dependency matches more than one rule, it's included in the first group that it matches.
- Any outdated dependencies that do not match a rule are updated in individual pull requests.

Parameters| Purpose  
---|---  
`IDENTIFIER`| Define an identifier for the group to use in branch names and pull request titles. This must start and end with a letter, and can contain letters, pipes `|`, underscores`_`, or hyphens`-`.  
`applies-to`| Specify which type of update the group applies to. When undefined, defaults to version updates. Supported values: `version-updates` or `security-updates`.  
`dependency-type`| Limit the group to a type. Supported values: `development` or `production`.  
`patterns`| Define one or more patterns to include dependencies with matching names.  
`exclude-patterns`| Define one or more patterns to exclude dependencies from the group.  
`update-types`| Limit the group to one or more semantic versioning levels. Supported values: `minor`, `patch`, and `major`.  
  
### `dependency-type` (`groups`)

Supported by: `bundler`, `composer`, `mix`, `maven`, `npm`, and `pip`.

By default, a group will include all types of dependencies.

- Use `development` to include only dependencies in the "Development dependency group."
- Use `production` to include only dependencies in the "Production dependency group."

### `patterns` and `exclude-patterns` (`groups`)

Both options support using `*` as a wild card to define matches with dependency names. If a dependency matches both a pattern and an exclude-pattern, then it is excluded from the group.

### `update-types` (`groups`)

By default, a group will include updates for all semantic versions (SemVer). SemVer is an accepted standard for defining versions of software packages, in the form `x.y.z`. Dependabot assumes that versions in this form are always `major.minor.patch`.

- Use `patch` to include patch releases.
- Use `minor` to include minor releases.
- Use `major` to include major releases.

For examples, see [Controlling which dependencies are updated by Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/controlling-dependencies-updated#specifying-the-semantic-versioning-level-to-ignore).

## `ignore`

Use with the `allow` option to define exactly which dependencies to maintain for a package ecosystem. Dependabot checks for all allowed dependencies and then filters out any ignored dependencies or versions. So a dependency that is matched by both an allow and an ignore will be ignored. For examples, see [Controlling which dependencies are updated by Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/controlling-dependencies-updated#ignoring-specific-dependencies).

Dependabot default behavior:

- All dependencies explicitly defined in a manifest are kept up to date by version updates.
- All dependencies defined in lock files with vulnerable dependencies are updated by security updates.

When `ignore` is used Dependabot uses the following process:

  1. Check for all explicitly **allowed** dependencies.

  2. Then filter out any **ignored** dependencies or versions.

If a dependency is matched by an `allow` and an `ignore` statement, then it is **ignored**.

Parameters| Purpose  
---|---  
`dependency-name`| Ignore updates for dependencies with matching names, optionally using `*` to match zero or more characters.  
`versions`| Ignore specific versions or ranges of versions.  
`update-types`| Ignore updates to one or more semantic versioning levels. Supported values: `version-update:semver-minor`, `version-update:semver-patch`, and `version-update:semver-major`.  
  
### `dependency-name` (`ignore`)

For most package managers, you should define a value that will match the dependency name specified in the lock or manifest file. A few systems have more complex requirements.

Package manager| Format required| Example  
---|---|---  
Gradle and Maven| `groupId:artifactId`| `org.kohsuke:github-api`  
Docker for image tags| The full name of the repository| For an image tag of `<account ID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/base/foo/bar/ruby:3.1.0-focal-jemalloc`, use `base/foo/bar/ruby`.  
  
### `versions` (`ignore`)

Use to ignore specific versions or ranges of versions. If you want to define a range, use the standard pattern for the package manager. For example:

- npm: use `^1.0.0`
- Bundler: use `~> 2.0`
- Docker: use Bundler version syntax
- NuGet: use `7.*`
- Maven: use `[1.4,)`

For examples, see [Controlling which dependencies are updated by Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/controlling-dependencies-updated#ignoring-specific-versions-or-ranges-of-versions).

### `update-types` (`ignore`)

Specify which semantic versions (SemVer) to ignore. SemVer is an accepted standard for defining versions of software packages, in the form `x.y.z`. Dependabot assumes that versions in this form are always `major.minor.patch`.

- Use `version-update:semver-patch` to include patch releases.
- Use `version-update:semver-minor` to include minor releases.
- Use `version-update:semver-major` to include major releases.

## `insecure-external-code-execution`

Supported by: `bundler`, `mix`, and `pip`.

Allow Dependabot to execute external code in the manifest during updates. For examples, see [Allowing external code execution](/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot#allowing-external-code-execution).

Dependabot default behavior:

- When you give Dependabot access to one or more registries, external code execution is automatically disabled to protect your code from compromised packages.
- Version updates may fail without the ability to execute code.

When you allow `insecure-external-code-execution`:

- Dependabot will execute code in the manifest as part of the version update process.
- The code has access to only the package managers in the registries associated with that `updates`setting. There is no access allowed to any of the registries defined in the top level `registries` configuration.
- This should enable the update to succeed but also could allow a compromised package to steal credentials or gain access to configured registries.

Supported value: `allow`.

## `labels`

Specify your own labels for all pull requests raised for a package manager. For examples, see [Customizing Dependabot pull requests to fit your processes](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/customizing-dependabot-prs).

Dependabot default behavior:

- All pull requests have a `dependencies` label.
- If you define more than one package manager, an additional label for the ecosystem or language is added to each pull request. For example: `java` for Gradle updates and `submodules` for git submodule updates.
- If semantic version (SemVer) labels are present in the repository, they will be applied automatically to indicate the type of version update (`major`, `minor`, or `patch`).
- Dependabot creates these default labels automatically, as necessary in your repository.

When `labels` is defined:

- The labels specified are used instead of the default labels.
- SemVer labels (if present in the repository) will still be applied in addition to any custom labels defined.
- If any of these labels is not defined in the repository, it is ignored.
- You can disable all labels, including the default labels, using `labels: [ ]`.

Setting this option will also affect pull requests for security updates to the manifest files of this package manager, unless you use `target-branch` to check for version updates on a non-default branch.

## `milestone`

Associate all pull requests raised for a package manager with a milestone. For examples, see [Customizing Dependabot pull requests to fit your processes](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/customizing-dependabot-prs).

Dependabot default behavior:

- No milestones are used.

When `milestone` is defined:

- All pull requests for the package manager are added to the milestone.

Supported value: the numeric identifier of a milestone.

Tip

If you view a milestone, the final part of the page URL, after `milestone`, is the identifier. For example: `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/milestone/3`, see [Viewing your milestone's progress](/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/viewing-your-milestones-progress).

## `multi-ecosystem-groups`

Define groups that span multiple package ecosystems to get a single Dependabot pull request that updates all supported package ecosystems. This approach helps reduce the number of Dependabot pull requests you receive and streamlines your dependency update workflow.

Dependabot default behavior:

- Create separate pull requests for each package ecosystem that has dependency updates.

When `multi-ecosystem-groups` is used:

- Updates across multiple package ecosystems in the same group are combined into a single pull request.
- Groups have their own schedules and can inherit or override individual ecosystem settings.

### `multi-ecosystem-group`

Assign individual package ecosystems to a multi-ecosystem group using the `multi-ecosystem-group` parameter in your `updates` configuration.

Important

Multi-ecosystem updates require specific configuration patterns and have unique parameter merging behavior. For complete setup instructions, configuration examples, and detailed parameter reference, see [Configuring multi-ecosystem updates for Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-multi-ecosystem-updates).

    # Basic `dependabot.yml` file defining a multi-ecosystem-group
    version: 2
    
    multi-ecosystem-groups:
      infrastructure:
        schedule:
          interval: "weekly"
    
    updates:
      - package-ecosystem: "docker"
        directory: "/"
        patterns: ["nginx", "redis"]
        multi-ecosystem-group: "infrastructure"
    
      - package-ecosystem: "terraform"
        directory: "/"
        patterns: ["aws"]
        multi-ecosystem-group: "infrastructure"
    

## `open-pull-requests-limit`

Change the limit on the maximum number of pull requests for version updates open at any time.

Dependabot default behavior:

- If five pull requests with version updates are open, no further pull requests are raised until some of those open requests are merged or closed.
- Security updates have a separate, internal limit of ten open pull requests which cannot be changed.

When `open-pull-requests-limit` is defined:

- Dependabot opens pull requests up to the defined integer value. A large value can be set to effectively remove the open pull request limit.
- You can temporarily disable version updates for a package manager by setting this option to zero, see [Disabling Dependabot version updates](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates#disabling-dependabot-version-updates).

## `package-ecosystem`

**Required option.** Define one `package-ecosystem` element for each package manager that you want Dependabot to monitor for new versions. The repository must also contain a dependency manifest or lock file for each package manager, see [Example `dependabot.yml` file](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates#example-dependabotyml-file).

Package manager| YAML value| Supported versions

uv| `uv`| v0  
vcpkg| `vcpkg`| Not applicable  
yarn| `npm`| v1, v2, v3, v4  
  
## `pull-request-branch-name.separator`

Specify a separator to use when generating branch names. For examples, see [Customizing Dependabot pull requests to fit your processes](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/customizing-dependabot-prs).

Dependabot default behavior:

- Generate branch names of the form: `dependabot/PACKAGE_MANAGER/DEPENDENCY`

When `pull-request-branch-name.separator` is defined:

- Use the specified character in place of `/`.

Supported values: `"-"`, `_`, `/`

Tip

The hyphen symbol must be escaped so it is not interpreted as starting an empty YAML list.

## `rebase-strategy`

Disable automatic rebasing of pull requests raised by Dependabot.

Dependabot default behavior is to rebase open pull requests when Dependabot detects any changes to a version or security update pull request. Dependabot checks for changes when:

- Your schedule runs to check for version updates.
- You reopen a closed Dependabot pull request.
- You change the value of `target-branch` in the Dependabot configuration file, see `target-branch`.
- A Dependabot pull request is in conflict after a recent push to the target branch.

When `rebase-strategy` is set to `disabled`, Dependabot stops rebasing pull requests.

Note

Pull requests that were open **before** you disable rebasing will continue to be rebased until 30 days after they were opened. This affects all pull requests that have conflicts with the target branch and all pull requests for version updates.

## `registries`

Configure access to private package registries to allow Dependabot to update a wider range of dependencies, see [Configuring access to private registries for Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot) and [Guidance for the configuration of private registries for Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/guidance-for-the-configuration-of-private-registries-for-dependabot).

There are 2 locations in the `dependabot.yml` file where you can use the `registries` key:

  1. At the top level, where you define the private registries you want to use and their access information, see [Configuring access to private registries for Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot).
  2. Within the `updates` blocks, where you can specify which private registries each package manager should use.

Dependabot default behavior is to raise pull requests only to update dependencies stored in publicly accessible registries.

When the Dependabot configuration file has a top-level `registries` section, defining access to one or more private registries, you can configure each `package-ecosystem` to use one or more of these private registries.

When `registries` is defined for a package manager:

- Each private registry specified for a package manager is checked for version and security updates.
- Dependabot uses the access details defined in the top-level `registries` section.

Supported values: `REGISTRY_NAME` or `"*"`

## `schedule`

**Required option.** Define how often to check for new versions for each package manager you configure using the `interval` parameter. Optionally, for daily and weekly intervals, you can customize when Dependabot checks for updates. For examples, see [Optimizing the creation of pull requests for Dependabot version updates](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/optimizing-pr-creation-version-updates).

Parameters| Purpose  
---|---  
`interval`| **Required.** Defines the frequency for Dependabot.  
`day`| Specify the day to run for a **weekly** interval.  
`time`| Specify the time to run.  
`cronjob`| Defines the cron expression if the interval type is `cron`.  
`timezone`| Specify the timezone of the `time` value.  
  
### `interval`

Supported values: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly`, `semiannually`, `yearly`, or `cron`

Each package manager **must** define a schedule interval.

- Use `daily` to run on every weekday, Monday to Friday.
- Use `weekly` to run once a week, by default on Monday.
- Use `monthly` to run on the first day of each month.
- Use `quarterly` to run on the first day of each quarter (January, April, July, and October).
- Use `semiannually` to run every six months, on the first day of January and July.
- Use `yearly` to run on the first day of January.
- Use `cron` for cron expression based scheduling option. See `cronjob`.

By default, Dependabot randomly assigns a time to apply all the updates in the configuration file. You can use the `time` and `timezone` parameters to set a specific runtime for all intervals. If you use a `cron` interval, you can define the update time with a `cronjob` expression.

### `day`

Supported values: `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`, or `sunday`

Optionally, run **weekly** updates for a package manager on a specific day of the week.

### `time`

Format: `hh:mm`

Optionally, run all updates for a package manager at a specific time of day. By default, times are interpreted as UTC.

### `cronjob`

Supported values: Valid cron expression in cron syntax or natural expression.

Cron syntax has five fields separated by a space, and each field represents a unit of time.

    ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
    │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
    │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
    │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
    │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)
    │ │ │ │ │
    * * * * *
    

Examples : `0 9 * * *`, `every day at 5pm`

`0 9 * * *` is equivalent to "every day at 9am". `every day at 5pm` is equivalent to `0 17 * * *`.

Note

- Timezones must be specified in the `timezone` parameter and not in the `cronjob`.
- A `cronjob` type schedule is required to use a `cron` interval.

    # Basic `dependabot.yml` file for cronjob

    version: 2
    updates:
    # Enable version updates for npm
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
        # Look for `package.json` and `lock` files in the `root` directory
        directory: "/"
        # Check the npm registry for updates based on `cronjob` value
        schedule:
          interval: "cron"
          cronjob: "0 9 ** *"

### `timezone`

Specify a time zone for the `time` value. The default time zone is `UTC`.

The time zone identifier must match a timezone in the database maintained by [iana](https://www.iana.org/time-zones), see [List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

## `target-branch`

Define a specific branch to check for version updates and to target pull requests for version updates against. For examples, see [Customizing Dependabot pull requests to fit your processes](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/customizing-dependabot-prs).

Dependabot default behavior:

- Dependabot uses the default branch for the repository, see [About the default branch](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch).

When `target-branch` is defined:

- Only manifest files on the target branch are checked for version updates.
- All pull requests for version updates are opened targeting the specified branch.
- Options defined for this `package-ecosystem` no longer apply to security updates because security updates always use the default branch for the repository.

## `exclude-paths`

Use to specify paths of directories and files that Dependabot should ignore when scanning for manifests and dependencies. This option is useful when you want to prevent updates for dependencies in certain locations, such as test assets, vendored code, or specific files.

Dependabot default behavior:

- All directories and files in the specified `directory` are included in the update scan unless excluded by this option.

When `exclude-paths` is defined:

- All files and directories matching the specified paths are ignored during update scans for the given `package-ecosystem` entry.

Parameter| Purpose  
---|---  
`exclude-paths`| A list of glob patterns for files or directories to ignore.  
  
Glob patterns are supported, such as `**` for recursive matching and `*` for single-segment wildcards. Patterns are relative to the `directory` specified for the update configuration. Each ecosystem can have its own `exclude-paths` settings.

### Example

    version: 2
    updates:
      - package-ecosystem: "npm"
        directory: "/"
        schedule:
          interval: "daily"
        exclude-paths:
          - "src/test/assets"
          - "vendor/**"
          - "src/*.js"
          - "src/test/helper.js"
    
    # Sample patterns that can be used-
    
    # Pattern: docs/*.json
    # Matches: docs/foo.json, docs/bar.json
    
    # Pattern: *.lock
    # Matches: Gemfile.lock, package.lock, foo.lock (in any directory)
    
    # Pattern: test/**
    # Matches: test/foo.rb, test/bar/baz.rb, test/any/depth/file.txt
    
    # Pattern: config/settings.yml
    # Matches: config/settings.yml
    
    # Pattern: **/*.md
    # Matches: README.md, docs/guide.md, any/depth/file.md
    
    # Pattern: src/*
    # Matches: src/main.rb, src/app.js
    # Does NOT match: src/utils/helper.rb
    
    # Pattern: hidden/.*
    # Matches: hidden/.env, hidden/.secret
    

In this example, Dependabot will ignore the `src/test/assets` directory, all files under `vendor/`, all JavaScript files directly under `src/`, and the specific file `src/test/helper.js` when scanning for updates.

## `vendor`

Supported by: `bundler` and `gomod` only.

Tell Dependabot to maintain your vendored dependencies as well as the dependencies defined by manifest files. A dependency is described as "vendored" or "cached" when you store the code within your repository, see [`bundle cache` documentation](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-cache.1.html) and [`go mod vendor` documentation](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-vendor).

For examples, see [Controlling which dependencies are updated by Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/controlling-dependencies-updated#updating-vendored-dependencies).

Dependabot default behavior:

- Maintain only dependencies recorded in the manifest and lock files identified for Bundler.
- Raise security and version update pull requests that update the version numbers recorded in the manifest and lock files.
- For Go modules, any vendored dependencies are automatically identified and maintained as if `vendor` was enabled.

When `vendor` is enabled:

- Dependabot also maintains dependencies for Bundler that are stored in the `_vendor/cache_` directory in the repository.
- Pull requests will sometimes contain updates to a dependency that is stored in the repository.

Supported values: `true` or `false`

## `versioning-strategy`

Supported by: `bundler`, `cargo`, `composer`, `mix`, `npm`, `pip`, `pub`

Define how Dependabot should edit manifest files. For examples, see [Controlling which dependencies are updated by Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/controlling-dependencies-updated#defining-a-versioning-strategy).

Dependabot default behavior:

- Try to differentiate between app and library dependencies.
- For apps, always increase the minimum version requirement to match the new version. The `increase` strategy.
- For libraries, widen the allowed version requirements to include both the new and old versions, when possible. The `widen` strategy.

When `versioning-strategy` is defined, Dependabot uses the strategy specified.

Value| Behavior  
---|---  
`auto`| Default behavior.  
`increase`| Always increase the minimum version requirement to match the new version. If a range already exists, typically this only increases the lower bound.  
`increase-if-necessary`| Leave the version requirement unchanged if it already allows the new release (Dependabot still updates the resolved version). Otherwise widen the requirement.  
`lockfile-only`| Only create pull requests to update lockfiles. Ignore any new versions that would require package manifest changes.  
`widen`| Widen the allowed version requirements to include both the new and old versions, when possible. Typically, this only increases the maximum allowed version requirement.  
  
For example, if the current version is `1.0.0` and the current constraint is `^1.0.0` the different strategies would raise the following updates:

New version `1.2.0`

- `increase`: new constraint `^1.2.0`
- `increase-if-necessary`: new constraint `^1.0.0`
- `widen`: new constraint `^1.0.0`

New version `2.0.0`

- `increase`: new constraint `^2.0.0`
- `increase-if-necessary`: new constraint `^2.0.0`
- `widen`: new constraint `>=1.0.0 <3.0.0`

Note

If the package manager you use does not yet support configuring the `versioning-strategy` parameter, or does not support a value you need. The strategy code is open source, so if you'd like a particular ecosystem to support a new strategy, you are always welcome to submit a pull request in <https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/>.

### Versioning tags

- Represent stages in the software release lifecycle, such as alpha, beta, and stable versions.
- Allow publishers to distribute their packages more effectively.
- Indicate the stability of a version and communicate what users should expect in terms of features and stability.

Dependabot recognizes a variety of versioning tags for pre-releases, stable versions, and custom tags across different ecosystems.

The `dependabot.yml` file doesn't control the versioning tags that you can use, but you can define in configuration options such as [`ignore`](/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference#ignore--) the supported versioning tags you want to ignore updates for.

#### Supported versioning tags

**Package Manager**| **YAML value**| **Supported Tags**| **Examples**  
---|---|---|---  
Maven| `maven`| `alpha, a, beta, b, milestone, m, rc, cr, sp, ga, final, release, snapshot`| `spring-security-web@5.6.0-SNAPSHOT`, `spring-core@5.2.0.RELEASE`  
npm| `npm`| `alpha`, `beta`, `canary`, `dev`, `experimental`, `latest`, `legacy`, `next`, `nightly`, `rc`, `release`, `stable`| `lodash@beta`, `react@latest`, `express@next`  
pnpm| `npm`| `alpha`, `beta`, `canary`, `dev`, `experimental`, `latest`, `legacy`, `next`, `nightly`, `rc`, `release`, `stable`| `lodash@1.2.0-alpha`, `react@alpha`, `vue@next`  
yarn| `npm`| `alpha`, `beta`, `canary`, `dev`, `experimental`, `latest`, `legacy`, `next`, `nightly`, `rc`, `release`, `stable`| `lodash@1.2.0-alpha`, `axios@latest`, `moment@nightly`  
  
#### Versioning tag glossary

- **`alpha`:** Early version, may be unstable and have incomplete features.
- **`beta`:** More stable than alpha but may still have bugs.
- **`canary`:** Regularly updated pre-release version for testing.
- **`dev`:** Represents development versions.
- **`experimental`:** Versions with experimental features.
- **`latest`:** The latest stable release.
- **`legacy`:** Older or deprecated versions.
- **`next`:** Upcoming release version.
- **`nightly`:** Versions built nightly; often includes the latest changes.
- **`rc`:** Release candidate, close to stable release.
- **`release`:** The official release version.
- **`stable`:** The most reliable, production-ready version.

## Top-level `registries` key

Specify authentication details that Dependabot can use to access private package registries, including registries hosted by GitLab or Bitbucket.

The value of the `registries` key is an associative array, each element of which consists of a key that identifies a particular registry and a value which is an associative array that specifies the settings required to access that registry. The following `dependabot.yml` file configures a registry identified as `dockerhub` in the `registries` section of the file and then references this in the `updates` section of the file.

    # Minimal settings to update dependencies stored in one private registry
    
    version: 2
    registries:
      dockerhub: # Define access for a private registry
        type: docker-registry
        url: registry.hub.docker.com
        username: octocat
        password: ${{secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD}}
    updates:
      - package-ecosystem: "docker"
        directory: "/docker-registry/dockerhub"
        registries:
          - dockerhub # Allow version updates for dependencies in this registry
        schedule:
          interval: "monthly"
    

You use the following options to specify access settings. Registry settings must contain a `type` and a `url`, and typically either a `username` and `password` combination or a `token`.

Parameters| Purpose  
---|---  
`REGISTRY_NAME`| **Required:** Defines an identifier for the registry.  
`type`| **Required:** Identifies the type of registry.  
Authentication details| **Required:** The parameters supported for supplying authentication details vary for registries of different types.  
`url`| **Required:** The URL to use to access the dependencies in this registry. The protocol is optional. If not specified, `https://` is assumed. Dependabot adds or ignores trailing slashes as required.  
`replaces-base`| If the boolean value is `true`, Dependabot resolves dependencies using the specified `url` rather than the base URL of that ecosystem.  
  
For in-depth information about available options, as well as recommendations and advice when configuring private registries, see [Guidance for the configuration of private registries for Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/guidance-for-the-configuration-of-private-registries-for-dependabot).

### `type` and authentication details

The parameters used to provide authentication details for access to a private registry vary according to the registry `type`.

Registry `type`| Required authentication parameters  
---|---  
`cargo-registry`| `token`  
`composer-repository`| `username` and `password`  
`docker-registry`| `username` and `password`  
`git`| `username` and `password`  
`hex-organization`| `organization` and `key`  
`hex-repository`| `repo` and `auth-key` optionally with the corresponding `public-key-fingerprint`  
`maven-repository`| `username` and `password`  
`npm-registry`| `username` and `password`  
or `token`  
`nuget-feed`| `username` and `password`  
or `token`  
`pub-registry`| `token`  
`python-index`| `username` and `password`  
or `token`  
`rubygems-server`| `username` and `password`  
or `token`  
`terraform-registry`| `token`  
  
All sensitive data used for authentication should be stored securely and referenced from that secure location, see [Configuring access to private registries for Dependabot](/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot).

Tip

If the account is a GitHub account, you can use a GitHub personal access token in place of the password.

### `url` and `replaces-base`

The `url` parameter defines where to access a registry. When the optional `replaces-base` parameter is enabled (`true`), Dependabot resolves dependencies using the value of `url` rather than the base URL of that specific ecosystem.
