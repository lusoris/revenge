# Scan from the command line

Run code scanning from the command line using the CodeQL CLI to configure scans, customize queries, and troubleshoot results.

## [Setting up the CodeQL CLI](/en/code-security/how-tos/scan-code-for-vulnerabilities/scan-from-the-command-line/setting-up-the-codeql-cli)

To get started with the CodeQL CLI, you need to download and set up the CLI so that it can access the tools and libraries required to create and analyze databases.

## [Advanced setup of the CodeQL CLI](/en/code-security/how-tos/scan-code-for-vulnerabilities/scan-from-the-command-line/advanced-setup-of-the-codeql-cli)

You can modify your CodeQL CLI setup to use a local checkout of the CodeQL repository for analysis, set up multiple versions of the CodeQL CLI, and analyze databases you have downloaded from GitHub.

## [Using custom queries with the CodeQL CLI](/en/code-security/how-tos/scan-code-for-vulnerabilities/scan-from-the-command-line/using-custom-queries-with-the-codeql-cli)

You can write your own CodeQL queries to find specific vulnerabilities and errors.

## [Testing query help files](/en/code-security/how-tos/scan-code-for-vulnerabilities/scan-from-the-command-line/testing-query-help-files)

You can use the CodeQL CLI to preview your query help files as Markdown and ensure they are valid.

## [Specifying command options in a CodeQL configuration file](/en/code-security/how-tos/scan-code-for-vulnerabilities/scan-from-the-command-line/specifying-command-options-in-a-codeql-configuration-file)

You can save default command options in a CodeQL configuration file.

## [Creating CodeQL CLI database bundles](/en/code-security/how-tos/scan-code-for-vulnerabilities/scan-from-the-command-line/creating-database-bundle-for-troubleshooting)

You can create a database bundle with CodeQL troubleshooting information.
