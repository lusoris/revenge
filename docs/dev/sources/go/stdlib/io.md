Overview
¶
Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives.
Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives,
such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that
abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.
Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with
various implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not
assume they are safe for parallel execution.

Variables
¶
View Source
var EOF =
errors
.
New
("EOF")
EOF is the error returned by Read when no more input is available.
(Read must return EOF itself, not an error wrapping EOF,
because callers will test for EOF using ==.)
Functions should return EOF only to signal a graceful end of input.
If the EOF occurs unexpectedly in a structured data stream,
the appropriate error is either
ErrUnexpectedEOF
or some other error
giving more detail.
View Source
var ErrClosedPipe =
errors
.
New
("io: read/write on closed pipe")
ErrClosedPipe is the error used for read or write operations on a closed pipe.
View Source
var ErrNoProgress =
errors
.
New
("multiple Read calls return no data or error")
ErrNoProgress is returned by some clients of a
Reader
when
many calls to Read have failed to return any data or error,
usually the sign of a broken
Reader
implementation.
View Source
var ErrShortBuffer =
errors
.
New
("short buffer")
ErrShortBuffer means that a read required a longer buffer than was provided.
View Source
var ErrShortWrite =
errors

New
("short write")
ErrShortWrite means that a write accepted fewer bytes than requested
but failed to return an explicit error.

New
("unexpected EOF")
ErrUnexpectedEOF means that EOF was encountered in the
middle of reading a fixed-size block or data structure.
Functions
¶
func
Copy
¶
func Copy(dst
Writer
, src
Reader
) (written
int64
, err
error
)
Copy copies from src to dst until either EOF is reached
on src or an error occurs. It returns the number of bytes
copied and the first error encountered while copying, if any.
A successful Copy returns err == nil, not err == EOF.
Because Copy is defined to read from src until EOF, it does
not treat an EOF from Read as an error to be reported.
If src implements
WriterTo
,
the copy is implemented by calling src.WriteTo(dst).
Otherwise, if dst implements
ReaderFrom
,
the copy is implemented by calling dst.ReadFrom(src).
Example
¶
package main

import (
"io"
"log"
"os"
"strings"
)

func main() {
r := strings.NewReader("some io.Reader stream to be read\n")

if _, err := io.Copy(os.Stdout, r); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}

}
Output:

func
CopyBuffer
¶
added in
go1.5
func CopyBuffer(dst
Writer
, src
Reader
, buf []
byte
) (written
int64
, err
error
)
CopyBuffer is identical to Copy except that it stages through the
provided buffer (if one is required) rather than allocating a
temporary one. If buf is nil, one is allocated; otherwise if it has
zero length, CopyBuffer panics.
If either src implements
WriterTo
or dst implements
ReaderFrom
,
buf will not be used to perform the copy.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"io"
"log"
"os"
"strings"
)

func main() {
r1 := strings.NewReader("first reader\n")
r2 := strings.NewReader("second reader\n")
buf := make([]byte, 8)

// buf is used here...
if _, err := io.CopyBuffer(os.Stdout, r1, buf); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}

// ... reused here also. No need to allocate an extra buffer.
if _, err := io.CopyBuffer(os.Stdout, r2, buf); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}

}
Output:

second reader
Share
Format
Run
func
CopyN
¶
func CopyN(dst
Writer
, src
Reader
, n
int64
) (written
int64
, err
error
)
CopyN copies n bytes (or until an error) from src to dst.
It returns the number of bytes copied and the earliest
error encountered while copying.
On return, written == n if and only if err == nil.
If dst implements
ReaderFrom
, the copy is implemented using it.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"io"
"log"
"os"
"strings"
)

func main() {
r := strings.NewReader("some io.Reader stream to be read")

log.Fatal(err)
}

}
Output:

Run
func
Pipe
¶
func Pipe() (*
PipeReader
, *
PipeWriter
)
Pipe creates a synchronous in-memory pipe.
It can be used to connect code expecting an
io.Reader
with code expecting an
io.Writer
.
Reads and Writes on the pipe are matched one to one
except when multiple Reads are needed to consume a single Write.
That is, each Write to the
PipeWriter
blocks until it has satisfied
one or more Reads from the
PipeReader
that fully consume
the written data.
The data is copied directly from the Write to the corresponding
Read (or Reads); there is no internal buffering.
It is safe to call Read and Write in parallel with each other or with Close.
Parallel calls to Read and parallel calls to Write are also safe:
the individual calls will be gated sequentially.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"fmt"
"io"
"log"
"os"
)

func main() {
r, w := io.Pipe()

go func() {
fmt.Fprint(w, "some io.Reader stream to be read\n")
w.Close()
}()

if _, err := io.Copy(os.Stdout, r); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}

}

Run
func
ReadAll
¶
added in
go1.16
func ReadAll(r
Reader
) ([]
byte
,
error
)
ReadAll reads from r until an error or EOF and returns the data it read.
A successful call returns err == nil, not err == EOF. Because ReadAll is
defined to read from src until EOF, it does not treat an EOF from Read
as an error to be reported.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"fmt"
"io"
"log"
"strings"
)

func main() {
r := strings.NewReader("Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind.")

b, err := io.ReadAll(r)
if err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}

fmt.Printf("%s", b)

}
Output:
Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind.

Run
func
ReadAtLeast
¶
func ReadAtLeast(r
Reader
, buf []
byte
, min
int
) (n
int
, err
error
)
ReadAtLeast reads from r into buf until it has read at least min bytes.
It returns the number of bytes copied and an error if fewer bytes were read.
The error is EOF only if no bytes were read.
If an EOF happens after reading fewer than min bytes,
ReadAtLeast returns
ErrUnexpectedEOF
.
If min is greater than the length of buf, ReadAtLeast returns
ErrShortBuffer
.
On return, n >= min if and only if err == nil.
If r returns an error having read at least min bytes, the error is dropped.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"fmt"
"io"
"log"
"strings"
)

func main() {
r := strings.NewReader("some io.Reader stream to be read\n")

buf := make([]byte, 14)
if _, err := io.ReadAtLeast(r, buf, 4); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Printf("%s\n", buf)

// buffer smaller than minimal read size.
shortBuf := make([]byte, 3)
if _, err := io.ReadAtLeast(r, shortBuf, 4); err != nil {
fmt.Println("error:", err)
}

// minimal read size bigger than io.Reader stream
longBuf := make([]byte, 64)
if _, err := io.ReadAtLeast(r, longBuf, 64); err != nil {

func
ReadFull
¶
func ReadFull(r
Reader
, buf []
byte
) (n
int
, err
error
)
ReadFull reads exactly len(buf) bytes from r into buf.
It returns the number of bytes copied and an error if fewer bytes were read.
The error is EOF only if no bytes were read.
If an EOF happens after reading some but not all the bytes,
ReadFull returns
ErrUnexpectedEOF
.
On return, n == len(buf) if and only if err == nil.
If r returns an error having read at least len(buf) bytes, the error is dropped.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"fmt"
"io"
"log"
"strings"
)

func main() {
r := strings.NewReader("some io.Reader stream to be read\n")

buf := make([]byte, 4)
if _, err := io.ReadFull(r, buf); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Printf("%s\n", buf)

// minimal read size bigger than io.Reader stream
longBuf := make([]byte, 64)

func
WriteString
¶
func WriteString(w
Writer
, s
string
) (n
int
, err
error
)
WriteString writes the contents of the string s to w, which accepts a slice of bytes.
If w implements
StringWriter
, [StringWriter.WriteString] is invoked directly.
Otherwise, [Writer.Write] is called exactly once.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"io"
"log"

func main() {
if _, err := io.WriteString(os.Stdout, "Hello World"); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)

Types
¶
type
ByteReader
¶
type ByteReader interface {
ReadByte() (
byte
,
error
)
}
ByteReader is the interface that wraps the ReadByte method.
ReadByte reads and returns the next byte from the input or
any error encountered. If ReadByte returns an error, no input
byte was consumed, and the returned byte value is undefined.
ReadByte provides an efficient interface for byte-at-time
processing. A
Reader
that does not implement  ByteReader
can be wrapped using bufio.NewReader to add this method.
type
ByteScanner
¶
type ByteScanner interface {
ByteReader
UnreadByte()
error
}
ByteScanner is the interface that adds the UnreadByte method to the
basic ReadByte method.
UnreadByte causes the next call to ReadByte to return the last byte read.
If the last operation was not a successful call to ReadByte, UnreadByte may
return an error, unread the last byte read (or the byte prior to the
last-unread byte), or (in implementations that support the
Seeker
interface)
seek to one byte before the current offset.

added in
go1.1
type ByteWriter interface {
WriteByte(c
byte
)

Reader
// underlying reader
N
int64
// max bytes remaining
}

.
func (*PipeReader)
CloseWithError
¶
func (r *
PipeReader

CloseWithError never overwrites the previous error if it exists
and always returns nil.
func (*PipeReader)
Read
¶
func (r *
PipeReader
) Read(data []
byte
) (n
int
, err
error
)
Read implements the standard Read interface:
it reads data from the pipe, blocking until a writer

type
ReadWriter
¶
type ReadWriter interface {
Reader

}
ReadWriter is the interface that groups the basic Read and Write methods.
type
Reader
¶
type Reader interface {
Read(p []
byte
) (n
int
, err
error
)
}
Reader is the interface that wraps the basic Read method.
Read reads up to len(p) bytes into p. It returns the number of bytes
read (0 <= n <= len(p)) and any error encountered. Even if Read
returns n < len(p), it may use all of p as scratch space during the call.
If some data is available but not len(p) bytes, Read conventionally
returns what is available instead of waiting for more.
When Read encounters an error or end-of-file condition after
successfully reading n > 0 bytes, it returns the number of
bytes read. It may return the (non-nil) error from the same call
or return the error (and n == 0) from a subsequent call.
An instance of this general case is that a Reader returning
a non-zero number of bytes at the end of the input stream may
return either err == EOF or err == nil. The next Read should
return 0, EOF.
Callers should always process the n > 0 bytes returned before
considering the error err. Doing so correctly handles I/O errors
that happen after reading some bytes and also both of the
allowed EOF behaviors.
If len(p) == 0, Read should always return n == 0. It may return a
non-nil error if some error condition is known, such as EOF.
Implementations of Read are discouraged from returning a
zero byte count with a nil error, except when len(p) == 0.
Callers should treat a return of 0 and nil as indicating that
nothing happened; in particular it does not indicate EOF.
Implementations must not retain p.
func
LimitReader
¶
func LimitReader(r
Reader
, n
int64
)
Reader
LimitReader returns a Reader that reads from r
but stops with EOF after n bytes.
The underlying implementation is a *LimitedReader.
Example

func
MultiReader
¶
func MultiReader(readers ...
Reader
)
Reader
MultiReader returns a Reader that's the logical concatenation of
the provided input readers. They're read sequentially. Once all
inputs have returned EOF, Read will return EOF.  If any of the readers
return a non-nil, non-EOF error, Read will return that error.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"io"
"log"
"os"
"strings"

func main() {
r1 := strings.NewReader("first reader ")
r2 := strings.NewReader("second reader ")
r3 := strings.NewReader("third reader\n")
r := io.MultiReader(r1, r2, r3)

func
TeeReader
¶
func TeeReader(r
Reader
, w
Writer
)
Reader
TeeReader returns a
Reader
that writes to w what it reads from r.
All reads from r performed through it are matched with
corresponding writes to w. There is no internal buffering -
the write must complete before the read completes.
Any error encountered while writing is reported as a read error.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"io"
"log"
"os"
"strings"
)

func main() {
var r io.Reader = strings.NewReader("some io.Reader stream to be read\n")

r = io.TeeReader(r, os.Stdout)

// Everything read from r will be copied to stdout.
if _, err := io.ReadAll(r); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)

type
ReaderAt
¶
type ReaderAt interface {
ReadAt(p []
byte
, off
int64
) (n
int
, err
error
)
}
ReaderAt is the interface that wraps the basic ReadAt method.
ReadAt reads len(p) bytes into p starting at offset off in the
underlying input source. It returns the number of bytes
read (0 <= n <= len(p)) and any error encountered.
When ReadAt returns n < len(p), it returns a non-nil error
explaining why more bytes were not returned. In this respect,
ReadAt is stricter than Read.
Even if ReadAt returns n < len(p), it may use all of p as scratch
space during the call. If some data is available but not len(p) bytes,
ReadAt blocks until either all the data is available or an error occurs.
In this respect ReadAt is different from Read.
If the n = len(p) bytes returned by ReadAt are at the end of the
input source, ReadAt may return either err == EOF or err == nil.
If ReadAt is reading from an input source with a seek offset,
ReadAt should not affect nor be affected by the underlying
seek offset.
Clients of ReadAt can execute parallel ReadAt calls on the
same input source.
Implementations must not retain p.
type
ReaderFrom
¶
type ReaderFrom interface {
ReadFrom(r
Reader
) (n
int64
, err
error
)
}
ReaderFrom is the interface that wraps the ReadFrom method.
ReadFrom reads data from r until EOF or error.
The return value n is the number of bytes read.
Any error except EOF encountered during the read is also returned.
The
Copy
function uses
ReaderFrom
if available.
type
RuneReader
¶
type RuneReader interface {
ReadRune() (r
rune
, size
int
, err
error
)
}
RuneReader is the interface that wraps the ReadRune method.
ReadRune reads a single encoded Unicode character
and returns the rune and its size in bytes. If no character is
available, err will be set.
type
RuneScanner
¶
type RuneScanner interface {
RuneReader
UnreadRune()
error
}
RuneScanner is the interface that adds the UnreadRune method to the
basic ReadRune method.
UnreadRune causes the next call to ReadRune to return the last rune read.
If the last operation was not a successful call to ReadRune, UnreadRune may
return an error, unread the last rune read (or the rune prior to the
last-unread rune), or (in implementations that support the
Seeker
interface)
seek to the start of the rune before the current offset.
type
SectionReader
¶
type SectionReader struct {
// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
SectionReader implements Read, Seek, and ReadAt on a section
of an underlying
ReaderAt
.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"io"
"log"
"os"
"strings"
)

func main() {
r := strings.NewReader("some io.Reader stream to be read\n")
s := io.NewSectionReader(r, 5, 17)

type
Seeker
¶
type Seeker interface {
Seek(offset
int64
, whence
int
) (
int64
,
error
)
}
Seeker is the interface that wraps the basic Seek method.
Seek sets the offset for the next Read or Write to offset,
interpreted according to whence:
SeekStart
means relative to the start of the file,
SeekCurrent
means relative to the current offset, and
SeekEnd
means relative to the end
(for example, offset = -2 specifies the penultimate byte of the file).
Seek returns the new offset relative to the start of the
file or an error, if any.
Seeking to an offset before the start of the file is an error.
Seeking to any positive offset may be allowed, but if the new offset exceeds
the size of the underlying object the behavior of subsequent I/O operations
is implementation-dependent.
type
StringWriter
¶
added in
go1.12
type StringWriter interface {
WriteString(s
string
) (n
int
, err
error
)
}
StringWriter is the interface that wraps the WriteString method.
type
WriteCloser
¶
type WriteCloser interface {
Writer
Closer
}
WriteCloser is the interface that groups the basic Write and Close methods.
type
WriteSeeker
¶
type WriteSeeker interface {
Writer
Seeker
}
WriteSeeker is the interface that groups the basic Write and Seek methods.
type
Writer
¶
type Writer interface {
Write(p []
byte
) (n
int
, err
error
)
}
Writer is the interface that wraps the basic Write method.
Write writes len(p) bytes from p to the underlying data stream.
It returns the number of bytes written from p (0 <= n <= len(p))
and any error encountered that caused the write to stop early.
Write must return a non-nil error if it returns n < len(p).
Write must not modify the slice data, even temporarily.
Implementations must not retain p.
var Discard
Writer
= discard{}
Discard is a
Writer
on which all Write calls succeed
without doing anything.
func
MultiWriter
¶
func MultiWriter(writers ...
Writer
)
Writer
MultiWriter creates a writer that duplicates its writes to all the
provided writers, similar to the Unix tee(1) command.
Each write is written to each listed writer, one at a time.
If a listed writer returns an error, that overall write operation
stops and returns the error; it does not continue down the list.
Example
¶
package main

import (
"fmt"
"io"
"log"
"strings"
)

func main() {
r := strings.NewReader("some io.Reader stream to be read\n")

var buf1, buf2 strings.Builder
w := io.MultiWriter(&buf1, &buf2)

if _, err := io.Copy(w, r); err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}

fmt.Print(buf1.String())
fmt.Print(buf2.String())

}
Output:
some io.Reader stream to be read

type
WriterAt
¶
type WriterAt interface {
WriteAt(p []
byte
, off
int64
) (n
int
, err
error
)
}
WriterAt is the interface that wraps the basic WriteAt method.
WriteAt writes len(p) bytes from p to the underlying data stream
at offset off. It returns the number of bytes written from p (0 <= n <= len(p))
and any error encountered that caused the write to stop early.
WriteAt must return a non-nil error if it returns n < len(p).
If WriteAt is writing to a destination with a seek offset,
WriteAt should not affect nor be affected by the underlying
seek offset.
Clients of WriteAt can execute parallel WriteAt calls on the same
destination if the ranges do not overlap.
Implementations must not retain p.
type
WriterTo
¶
type WriterTo interface {
WriteTo(w
Writer
) (n
int64
, err
error
)
}
WriterTo is the interface that wraps the WriteTo method.
WriteTo writes data to w until there's no more data to write or
when an error occurs. The return value n is the number of bytes
written. Any error encountered during the write is also returned.
The Copy function uses WriterTo if available.
