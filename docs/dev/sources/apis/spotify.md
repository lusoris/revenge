Spotify Web API enables the creation of applications that can interact with
Spotify's streaming service, such as retrieving content metadata, creating and managing playlists, or controlling playback.

Getting started

This is where the magic begins! The following steps will help you to get
started with your journey towards creating some awesome music apps using the
API:

Log into the

dashboard

using your Spotify account.

Create an app

and select
"Web API" for the question asking which APIs are you planning to use. Once you have created
your app, you will have access to the app credentials. These will be required
for API
