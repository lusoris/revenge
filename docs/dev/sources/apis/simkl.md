We’ve worked very hard to make Simkl the dream “TV, Anime and Movie Tracker”.
However, chances are it doesn’t do 100% of what you need it to do. Luckily for you, we added an API so you
can extend Simkl’s functionality and build more apps.

Read the
API
documentation
, get ideas how you could use the API. Ask questions and help directlty at
support@simkl.com or our
Developer Chat on Discord
.
We’re always happy to help and add new API for your needs.
Create
Use the Simkl API to create apps for the Simkl community. Simkl API
is simple to use and powers multiple apps already.
