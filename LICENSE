## Why AGPL-3.0?

Revenge is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)
for the following reasons:

1. **Network Protection**: Unlike GPL, AGPL requires that users who interact
   with the software over a network (e.g., a web service) must be able to
   receive the source code. This is critical for a media server that is
   accessed via web interfaces and APIs.

2. **Strong Copyleft**: Ensures that derivative works remain open source,
   preventing proprietary forks that could fragment the community.

3. **Patent Protection**: AGPL-3.0 includes explicit patent grants, protecting
   contributors and users from patent claims.

4. **Community Alignment**: Similar to other self-hosted media server projects
   like Nextcloud (AGPL) and many privacy-focused applications.

5. **Commercial Fairness**: Companies using Revenge in SaaS offerings must
   contribute back their modifications, ensuring fair play.
