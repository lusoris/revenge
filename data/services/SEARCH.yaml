wiki_overview: Search instantly across your entire library using Typesense. Find movies,
  shows, music, and people with typo-tolerant full-text search. Results are filtered
  by user permissions - you only see content you have access to. Search supports filters
  (year, genre, rating), facets, and sorting. Separate collections per media type
  ensure fast, relevant results.
