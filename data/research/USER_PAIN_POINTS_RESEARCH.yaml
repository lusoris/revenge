wiki_tagline: '> What users hate about existing media servers'
wiki_overview: This research documents common complaints about Jellyfin, Plex, and
  Emby from Reddit, forums, and GitHub issues. Key pain points include slow library
  scans, incorrect metadata matching, complicated setup processes, poor mobile experiences,
  and transcoding problems. Revenge addresses each issue with local-first metadata
  caching, smart matching algorithms, streamlined setup wizards, mobile-first design,
  and hardware-accelerated transcoding.
