wiki_tagline: '> How we use Git branches for features, releases, and hotfixes'
wiki_overview: Revenge uses a Gitflow-style branching strategy. The main branch contains
  production-ready code, while develop is the integration branch for the next release.
  Create feature/* branches for new work, fix/* for bug fixes. All merges require
  pull request review. Commits follow Conventional Commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:)
  for automatic changelog generation. Git hooks enforce commit message format and
  run linters before push.
