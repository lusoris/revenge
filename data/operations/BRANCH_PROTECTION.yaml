wiki_tagline: '> Rules that protect main and develop branches from accidental changes'
wiki_overview: Branch protection rules prevent direct pushes to main and develop branches.
  All changes must go through pull requests with at least one approval. CI checks
  (tests, linting, coverage) must pass before merging. Force pushes are disabled to
  preserve commit history. These rules are configured in GitHub repository settings
  and ensure code quality and review for all changes.
